If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end o f its full duration. &nl; At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot o f 4th level or higher, the damage o f an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

Its mind fills in any gaps in the details o f your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creatures memory isnt altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends. A modified memory doesnt necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creatures natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory o f how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner. A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creatures true memory. &nl; At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot o f 6th level or higher, you can alter the targets memories o f an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creatures past (9th level).

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fallit w as pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. An affected target is so convinced o f the phantasms reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool o f acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasms area or within 5 feet o f the phantasm, provided that the illusion is o f a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

Phantom Steed				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Ritual			COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 minute	RANGE:30 feet		DURATION:1 hour			DESC:Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space o f your choice within range. You decide the creatures appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any o f the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff o f smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed. For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed o f 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.	SOURCEPAGE:PHB								
Planar Ally				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Conjuration				COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:60 feet		DURATION:Instantaneous			DESC:You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being o f cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creatures name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DMs choice). When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isnt obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety o f forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation o f gold or m agic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift o f treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule o f thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creatures ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration o f service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creatures service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member o f it, receiving a full share o f experience points awarded.	SOURCEPAGE:PHB								
Planar Binding				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Abjuration				COMPS:V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)	CASTTIME:1 hour	RANGE:60 feet		DURATION:24 hours	SAVEINFO:Charisma		DESC:With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting o f the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center o f an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion o f the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature w as summoned or created by another spell, that spells duration is extended to match the duration o f this spell. A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best o f its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your w ords to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane o f existence. If you are on a different plane o f existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends. &nl; At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot o f a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot. &nl; Material components: a jewel worth at least 1000gp, which the spell consumes.

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City o f Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace o f Dispater on the second level o f the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City o f Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street o f Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DMs discretion. Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane o f existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle. You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane o f existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence. &nl; Material components: a forked metal rod worth at least 250 gp attuned to a particular plane of existance.

There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits. If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas o f any size within the spells area from being affected. If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount o f food when harvested.	SOURCEPAGE:PHB

Polymorph				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:60 feet		DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	SAVEINFO:Wisdom		DESC:This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a W isdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the targets (or the targets level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The targets game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics o f the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality. The target assumes the hit points o f its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number o f hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesnt reduce the creatures normal form to 0 hit points, it isnt knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature o f its new form, and it cant speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The targets gear melds into the new form. The creature cant activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any o f its equipment. &nl; Material components: a ceterpillar cocoon.

Prismatic Wall				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Abjuration				COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:60 feet		DURATION:10 minutes			DESC:A shimmering, multicolored plane o f light forms a vertical opaque wallup to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thickcentered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted. The wall sheds bright light out to a range o f 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet o f it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.

The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration o f the spell. A rod o f cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it. &nl; 1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks cant pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. &nl; 2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks cant pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. &nl; 3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it. &nl; 4. Green.

A passwall spell, or another spell o f equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. &nl; 5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. &nl; 6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end o f each o f its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures dont need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells cant be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell o f equal or higher level. &nl; 7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a W isdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane o f the DMs choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isnt its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell o f equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.	SOURCEPAGE:PHB
