Ball Lightning Spell:

Ball Lightning
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./levels)
Effect: One lightning ball 2/levels
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: Yes
You create one 3-foot-diameter ball of concentrated
electricity per 2 levels (maximum 15 balls) that shed
light as candles and move under your control. A ball of
lightning deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to
anything it touches, including creatures that attack it or
move through it. When you create the balls of lightning,
you mentally program them to move as you desire, even
around corners. Once programmed, a ball's orders cannot
be changed. A ball can move up to 100 feet per round
and flies with perfect maneuverability. When a lightning
ball strikes a creature, the ball stops and remains in place
for the remainder of the spell's duration. A ball dissipates
if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's
range. A ball can only "see" under the available light
conditions (including the light the ball itself sheds).
For example, you could program one lightning ball to
follow the left wall of a corridor and strike the first
creature it "sees," another to follow the right wall and do
the same, and the remainder to follow 5 feet behind you
in a semicircle. The first two lightning balls would turn
corners to remain following the walls, even if this took
them out of your line of sight, and strike the first creature
they "see," which would cancel their program and leave
them in their target.s square. Directing the balls is a free
action on the round the spell is cast and a moveequivalent
action on any other round.
A creature struck by a lightning ball or that touches one
with natural or melee weapons gets a Reflex saving
throw for half damage. Damage from multiple balls
resting in the same square stacks. A creature struck by
multiple balls of lightning in a round (or entering a
square with multiple lightning balls) gets a saving throw
for each. A creature with SR makes separate SR checks
against each lightning ball, with success meaning that
ball cannot harm the creature.
Material Component: A handful of copper and iron
pellets.

Favor of Ilmater spell:
Add to the end of the second paragraph: The target
cannot exceed her maximum hit points; any in excess of
this amount are lost.

Divine Fortitude spell:
variant: The target
becomes immune to subdual damage, charm effects,
compulsions, and attacks that function by causing pain.
Any attacks (whether present on the target when the spell
is cast or occurring after the spell is cast) that cause these
effects or cause subject to be dazed, exhausted, fatigued,
nauseated, staggered, or stunned are suspended for the
duration of the spell (causing the target to wake if
unconscious from one of these effects). The target
remains conscious at –1 to –9 hit points and can take a
partial action each round when in that state. This variant
of the spell lasts 1 minute/level. When the spell ends, any
effects suspended by the spell that would otherwise still
be in effect (such as fatigue, which normally requires 8
hours of rest to abate) return. Effects with durations that
expired during the duration of this spell do not resume
when the spell ends.

Pact of Martyrdom spell:
Any excess hit points above the target's normal
maximum hit points are lost.
