# CATEGORY=Special Ability|Incantatrix ~ Instant Metamagic.MOD	DESC:The incantatrix cannot use this ability if the metamagicked spell would normally use a spell slot of a higher level than she could cast. For example, a Wiz5/Incantatrix4 could not use an instant metamagic Still Spell any of her 5th-level spells because she does not have any spell slots above 5th level.	SOURCEPAGE:MoF30e	
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spelldancer ~ Spells per Day.MOD	DESC:At each spelldancer level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a spelldancer, the player must decide to which class to add each spelldancer level for the purpose of determining spells per day when she adds the new level.

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spelldancer ~ Spelldance.MOD	DESC:If a spelldancer's Constitution modifier decreases so that she has exceeded the number of rounds she could safely spelldance, she must immediately make a successful Fortitude save for every round of excess spelldancing; each failure deals the above penalties.

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spellfire Channeler ~ Increased Storage.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:The channeler's capacity for storing spellfire energy levels is multiplied by the listed value. However, storing spellfire energy levels in excess of the channeler's Constitution score is dangerous, with different effects depending upon the number of levels stored. Regardless of the number of spellfire energy levels stored, a channeler can voluntarily expend only a number of spellfire energy levels per round equal to her Constitution score. (Involuntary expenditure, such as that noted above, isn't limited in this way.)	SOURCEPAGE:MoF30e	
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spellfire Channeler ~ Rapid Blast.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:At 4th level, the spellfire channeler can release two blasts of spellfire as a full-round action. This increases to three blasts per standard action at 8th level. Each blast after the first suffers a cumulative -2 penalty to attack rolls (-0 for the first blast, -2 for the second, and -4 for the third).	SOURCEPAGE:MoF30e	
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spellfire Channeler ~ Crown of Fire.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:By expending 10 spellfire energy levels, a channeler can manifest the crown of fire, which appears as a halo of spellfire around her head and provides light equal to a daylight spell. The crown of fire gives her damage reduction 10/+1 and automatically destroys all nonmagical weapons that strike her (after they deal damage, if any). The crown of fire grants the channeler spell resistance 32 (as the spell resistance spell). Maintaining the crown of fire requires expending 10 spellfire energy levels each round, which can be done as a free action. The crown of fire does not interfere with the channeler's actions, including using other spellfire abilities.	SOURCEPAGE:MoF30e	
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spellfire Channeler ~ Drain Permanent Item.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:The channeler can drain power from permanent magic items by touch as a standard action. If the item is held or worn, the channeler must make a melee touch attack to touch it, which provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. The channeler must make a level check (1d20+class level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the item to drain it. A success means the item's properties are suppressed (as if affected by dispel magic) for 24 hours and the channeler gains spellfire energy levels equal to half the item's caster level.
