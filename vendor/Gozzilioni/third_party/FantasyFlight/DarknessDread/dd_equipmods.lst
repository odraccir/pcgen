Combat Penalty	KEY:BOOK_CMB_PENALTY	TYPE:Book	COST:0	VISIBLE:QUALIFY			SOURCEPAGE:DD	PRETYPE:1,Book																				ASSIGNTOALL:YES	SPROP:Any character that is proficient with all martial weapons has the training needed to understand this advice. If such a character spends a week studying the book and makes an Intelligence check (DC 10), he notices that the book’s tactics are flawed and ignores them. Otherwise, he suffers a –1 penalty on attacks and initiative for a number of encounters equal to 12 – his Intelligence score, with a minimum of 1.
False Lore	KEY:BOOK_FALSE_LORE	TYPE:Book	COST:0	VISIBLE:QUALIFY			SOURCEPAGE:DD	PRETYPE:1,Book																				ASSIGNTOALL:YES	SPROP:False lore might be something as simple as information that grants a penalty on Knowledge checks to misleading accounts that could result in the characters’ deaths. A book might include false clues that serve as red herrings or disguise a monster’s weaknesses. In this case, the players simply learn the information and must decide for themselves if they trust it. Otherwise, when referencing a book a character may suffer a penalty to certain Knowledge skill areas of study. In this case, a character with the penalized Knowledge skill can determine that the book is useless with a day of study and a successful Knowledge check (DC 20). Normally, this modifier can range from a –1 to –10 circumstance penalty.
Flawless Spell	KEY:BOOK_FLAWLESS_SPELL	TYPE:Book	COST:0	VISIBLE:QUALIFY			SOURCEPAGE:DD	PRETYPE:1,Book																				ASSIGNTOALL:YES	SPROP:A wizard must study the book for one day and make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell level) in order to understand it. He can then prepare the spell from the tome as normal. However, if the Spellcraft check’s total result is 25 or higher, the caster notices the errors within it. Otherwise, they escape his notice. Each time the character casts the spell, he must make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + the spell level) or he suffers disastrous results. The spell causes an explosion of arcane energy in a 60-ft. spread centered on the caster that deals 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell. A Reflex save (DC 18) halves this damage. The caster does not gain a save against this effect.
