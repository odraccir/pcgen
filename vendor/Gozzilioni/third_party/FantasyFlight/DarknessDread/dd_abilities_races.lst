Alien Psychology	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Abominations are immune to all mind-influencing effects, fear-based effects, and all spells from the enchantment school. Their minds work in such strange ways, if they even have minds, that mortal spells and magic cannot hope to alter them.	KEY:Abomination ~ Alien Psychology																		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Immunity To Mind-Affecting|Immunity To Fear|Immunity To Enchantment									SOURCEPAGE:DD																
Bizarre Psychology	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The forms and bodies that abominations adopt are warped shells spawned by the cosmos to contain the utter blasphemy of their intrusion into the physical world. They tend to take on horrific guises partially because an intelligent mind cannot comprehend their true forms. The cosmos literally spawns a husk of flesh and bone to contain their psychic and physical aspects when they breach the wall into the physical planes. Thus, abominations are immune to critical hits, they cannot be flanked, and they never suffer sneak attack damage. They are immune to disease, poison, stunning and sleep effects, and death effects.

Unknown Philosophy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An abomination never has an alignment. As a creature from a wholly alien realm, it has no conception of or need for moral and philosophical values as mortal creatures know them. Any spell, effect, or ability that relies on alignment always fails to affect them. If a spell or ability lists an effect that applies if none of its alignment-specific ones work, use that default result. Any effect or ability that specifies an alignment fails against an abomination.	KEY:Abomination ~ Unknown Philosophy																											SOURCEPAGE:DD																
Unholy Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Reality shifts and strains its very fiber to accommodate an abomination's presence. By the same token, a mortal creature's mind can barely comprehend the utter blasphemy of reality that an abomination presents.

Magical Sink	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationStrength	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Spells cast at the creature interact with it in a strange manner, feeding its physical form and allowing it to flourish. If the creature succeeds in a save against a spell by 5 or more, it heals 3 hit points per spell level. It still suffers any negative effects that might go with a successful save.	KEY:Abomination ~ Magical Sink																											SOURCEPAGE:DD																
Fast Healing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationStrength	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The creature derives sustenance from the air, heat, or some other common environmental feature.

Abomination Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:They are utterly impossible creatures, yet they exist and can cross over into the world. Their intellects are impossible to fathom, and their motives and reasoning seem capricious or random at best, yet none can deny their great power and seemingly malevolent desires. Even demons, devils, and other powerful evil outsiders fear these creatures. Most telling of all, abominations have no place in the cosmic moral scale represented by alignment. They are immune to all effects and spells that deal with it, such as detect evil or chaos hammer. While their actions might seem to fit into one of the alignments, they have no special bond to the moral and philosophical measures that describe all living things.

Race Traits ~ Cackling Perceptor	CATEGORY:Internal	TYPE:Special	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=CacklingPerceptorRaceTrait																													
Babbling Madness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CacklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cackling perceptor makes strange, gibbering sounds that resemble a madman’s laughter. Any creature that comes within 60 ft. of one of these monsters must make a Will save (DC %1) or act as if under the effects of confusion for 2d10 rounds. This noise results from the perceptor’s attempts to communicate with other beings. Their cosmic insight into the nature of reality allows them to alter and manipulate the psyches of other creatures with sound, though there is no apparent reason or order in the actions they compel others to commit. This is a mind-influencing effect.|BabblingMadnessDC	KEY:Cackling Perceptor ~ Babbling Madness				DEFINE:BabblingMadnessDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BabblingMadnessDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|BabblingMadnessDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Babbling Madness)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Babbling Madness									SOURCEPAGE:DD
Cosmic Awareress	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CacklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The perceptor’s supernatural insight into the material world makes it almost impossible to take by surprise. It sees into time, space, emotion, and other dimensions that humans cannot fathom. It counts as taking 20 in all Listen and Spot checks and its sight and hearing extend up to 200 feet in all directions despite any physical barriers that surround it.	KEY:Cackling Perceptor ~ Cosmic Awareness																											SOURCEPAGE:DD
Dimensional Slip	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CacklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Using its strange sight, a perceptor can spot folds in reality that allow it to move to a distant spot with a single step. It can also slide into strange dimensions that interact with the real world but do not cross it. The perceptor can cast dimension door at will. In addition, the perceptor can gain the benefits of improved invisibility at will. While this talent duplicates spell effects, it is not magical in nature. Instead, the perceptor manipulates reality in a manner that other creatures simply cannot perceive or understand. Activating either of this ability’s uses counts as a standard action.
