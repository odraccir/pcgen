Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a fiend of blasphemy gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the fiend of blasphemy must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a fiend of blasphemy with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Fiend of blasphemy bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the fiend's Wisdom modifier (if any). When the fiend gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1stlevel spells at 1st level, the fiend of blasphemy gets only bonus spells (in addition to a domain spell slot, which it receives at every spell level). A fiend of blasphemy without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level except for its domain spell. The fiend of blasphemy's spell list appears below. A fiend of blasphemy prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does. A fiend of blasphemy gains access to two of its patron deity's domains. A fiend of blasphemy can choose prestige domains (described in Defenders of the Faith) offered by its deity. As with a cleric, each domain gives the fiend access to a domain spell at each spell level as well as a granted power. The fiend prepares one or the other of the available domain spells at each spell level each day.

Blood Oath	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiend of blasphemy has the ability to perform a ritual of initiation that binds cult members to the fiend's service. The ritual forges a magical, mental bond between the fiend and those mortals who participate. It requires one day of preparation, during which time the fiend must meditate and ready a room in which the ritual will take place. The ritual itself lasts for 2 hours, plus an additional 10 minutes per mortal initiate. If either the preparation or the ritual is interrupted, the process is ruined and the fiend must start again. All creatures in the room (and no more than 60 feet away from the fiend of blasphemy) when the ritual begins or that enter that area during the ritual must make a Will save (DC 10 + fiend's class level + fiend's Cha modifier) or be affected as if by an enthrall spell. Willing participants in the ritual receive a -4 penalty on this saving throw, while hostile onlookers receive a +4 bonus. After the first 2 hours of the ritual, each initiate is subjected to the fiend's individual attention for 10 minutes, during which time the bond between the two is formed. If an initiate wishes to resist the bond, she can attempt a Will saving throw (DC 15 + fiend's class level + fiend's Cha modifier). Willing participants may voluntarily fail their saving throws. If an initiate makes a successful saving throw, the fiend of blasphemy is aware that the bond was not properly formed, but this does not interrupt the ritual. Fiends often allow mortals to believe their resistance went undetected until after the ritual is complete.

Locate Cultist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:One effect of the blood oath is a sort of telepathic bond between the fiend of blasphemy and its cultists. At will, a fiend of blasphemy can use a supernatural power identical to locate creature to sense the location of any creature that has sworn a blood oath with the fiend.

Undetectable Alignment	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiend of blasphemy's alignment is constantly concealed from all forms of divination, as the undetectable alignment spell.

Transfer Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a fiend of blasphemy can use a power similar to the cleric spell imbue with spell ability to grant its cult members access to its spell-like abilities. A fiend can give one creature that has sworn it a blood oath access to as many of its own spell-like abilities as it desires. The cultist can use the ability once per day, with all variable characteristics (including caster level and save DC) determined as if the fiend were using the ability. When it transfers a spell-like ability, the fiend cannot use the ability as often as usual: It can use abilities normally available at will only 4 times per day, and loses one use per day from other abilities. A fiend can bestow the same ability on multiple worshipers, or allow worshipers to use the ability more than once per day, but in doing so loses more of its own daily uses of the ability. For example, a glabrezu fiend of blasphemy can grant two of its cultists the ability to use dispel magic once per day, or grant a single cultist the ability to dispel magic twice per day, but the glabrezu itself can only dispel magic three times per day as long as the cultists retain their ability. The fiend of blasphemy  can revoke the transfer at any time as a free action. If the cultist had already used the ability during the current day, it counts as if the fiend had used it that day as well.

Sponsor Worshiper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiend of blasphemy that has reached at least 3rd level can channel spellcasting ability from its own fiendish master to mortals with levels in the cleric class. A fiend can sponsor a cleric whose level is no higher than twice the fiend's class level. Thus, a 3rd-level fiend of blasphemy can sponsor a cleric of up to 6th level, who receives access to the full complement of cleric spells as well as any two domains selected from those offered by the fiend's master.

Scry on Cultist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a fiend of blasphemy can scry on any creature that has sworn it a blood oath, as if using the scrying spell. The fiend cannot scry on cultists on other planes. The fiend can use this ability on any given cultist once per day, but there is no limit to how many cultists it can scry on in a day.

Torture Cultist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a fiend of blasphemy gains the ability to inflict pain on those who have sworn it a blood oath. Distance is not a factor, but the fiend cannot torture a cultist who is on a different plane. When the fiend uses this power, the target cultist suffers excruciating pain. The affected creature takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round per class level of the fiend. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + fiend's class level + fiend's Cha modifier) lessens the penalty to -2.

Kill Cultist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfBlasphemyClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level, a fiend of blasphemy gains the ability to kill those who have sworn it a blood oath if they displease it. Distance is not a factor, but the fiend cannot kill a cultist who is on a different plane. The affected creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + fiend's class level + fiend's Cha modifier) or die. If the save is successful, the creature takes 3d6+6 points of damage. This is a death effect.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Fiends of corruption gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.	KEY:Fiend of Corruption ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Corruption	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Alternate Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiend of corruption has the ability to assume any humanoid form of Small to Large size as a standard action. While using this ability, the fiend gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. Fiends of corruption typically use this ability to make themselves appear pleasing or even desirable to their intended targets. It is hard, after all, to manipulate a person who is running away, howling in terror. Fiends often use sexual temptation as a tool for corruption, but the seduction is simply a means to the eventual end of the mortal's damnation, not an end in itself. Once drawn into an intimate relationship with a fiend (particularly if this relationship is considered illicit), mortals are more susceptible to further temptations and blackmail.	KEY:Fiend of Corruption ~ Alternate Form																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Corruption	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Fiend's Favor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a fiend of corruption can grant a touched creature a +3 bonus to one of the creature's ability scores. This bonus stacks with any other bonus the creature may already have, and lasts for one day. When the effect expires, the creature takes a -3 penalty to the same ability score for the next day. Another application of fiend's favor not only negates the penalty, but restores the full bonus. Fiends of corruption are quite free with this ability-at least at first. They often approach people who are in need of a short-term ability boost for a specific situation, offering them the "favor" for free or in exchange for performing a simple task. The next day, when the affected creature is suffering from the penalty, the price for restoring the favor gets slightly higher, and so on-until a power-hungry character is willing to do just about anything in return.

Suggestion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a fiend of corruption gains the ability to use suggestion three times per day. The saving throw DC is 15 + the fiend's Charisma modifier (as though the fiend had Spell Focus [Enchantment]). The fiend of corruption's class level is its caster level. If the target of this ability is currently under the influence of a charm person cast by the fiend, she takes a -2 penalty on her saving throw. A fiend of corruption is generally interested in corrupting mortals and seducing them toward evil. A mortal who commits an evil act because of a magical compulsion is not fully corrupted, and the taint of evil can easily be removed with an atonement spell. Even so, using this power can be a useful first step toward the mortal's ultimate damnation. Once the deed is done, the fiend has a stronger foothold for later temptation or even blackmail.

Mind Shielding	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a fiend of blasphemy gains complete immunity to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to magically discern its alignment. This ability solidifies a fiend's disguise, cloaking its thoughts as well as its flesh.	KEY:Fiend of Corruption ~ Mind Shielding																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Corruption	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Mark of Justice	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, a fiend of corruption can use mark of justice once per day, though the ability might better be termed "mark of iniquity" when used in this manner. A fiend of corruption uses this ability to cement a good person's descent into evil. Once its victim is living an immoral life, the fiend uses mark of justice to ensure that the victim does not return to her old ways or seek atonement. While good clerics typically place a mark of justice in a visible place on the subject, fiends generally hide their marks in locations that are not obvious.

Fiendish Graft	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per month, a fiend of corruption of 4th level or higher can bestow a fiendish graft or symbiont (see Appendix 3) on a willing mortal. Fiendish grafts are offered as rewards to characters who are already well along the path of corruption.	KEY:Fiend of Corruption ~ Fiendish Graft																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Corruption	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Major Creation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4th-level fiend of corruption gains the ability to use major creation three times per day. The fiend of corruption's class level is its caster level. Fiends of corruption use this ability to offer concrete temptation to mortals whose tastes run to material wealth and finery.

Geas	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Also at 5th level, a fiend of corruption can use geas/quest once per day. As with suggestion, magical compulsion is not an ideal way to accomplish the fiend of corruption's goals, but works admirably as a step along the way.

Temptation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a fiend of corruption gains the ability to offer good creatures the opportunity to change their alignment to evil. This works like the redemption or temptation function of the atonement spell, and the fiend can use this ability whenever the opportunity arises.	KEY:Fiend of Corruption ~ Temptation																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Corruption	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Grant Wish	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 6th-level fiend of corruption can grant a wish to a mortal (not an elemental, outsider, or nonliving creature) once per day. Using this ability costs the fiend experience points as if it were casting a wish spell, so fiends never use this ability lightly. A fiend of corruption typically uses this ability as part of a soul bargain (see below), allowing it to grant its mortal target's every desire in exchange for ownership of the mortal's soul.

Soul Bargain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfCorruptionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level, a fiend of corruption gains the ability to enter a binding agreement with a mortal, at the cost of the mortal's soul. The mortal victim must enter into the soul bargain willingly. Upon the mortal's death (by any means), her soul is transferred to a gem (prepared as with the soul bind spell when the bargain is forged), even if the gem and the mortal are not on the same plane at the time. The bargain requires 1 hour to complete, and is utterly inviolable once forged. The only way to escape a soul bargain is to recover the gem after the mortal's death and break it, freeing her soul and allowing her to be restored to life through the normal means. It is quite common for fiends of corruption, as soon as a soul bargain is complete, to return to their native plane and await the mortal's death, or at least deposit the gem in a safe place before returning to the Material Plane to hasten the victim's demise.

Ethereal Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At will, a fiend of possession can become ethereal, as though using etherealness as cast by a sorcerer of the fiend's total Hit Dice or its sorcerer caster level (when using its spell-like abilities) plus its fiend of possession level, whichever is higher. Possessing an object or creature effectively ends a use of this ability, so time spent in another body or object does not count against the duration of this ability.

Hide Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiend in possession of an object or creature can attempt to hide its presence by making a special Hide check. This "mental" Hide check uses the fiend's Intelligence modifier instead of its Dexterity modifier. A successful check allows a fiend of possession to avoid virtually anything that would betray its presence in the possessed creature or object: it can pass through a magic circle against evil, enter a temple warded by forbiddance, or escape detection via detect evil. The DC for this Hide check is the same as the saving throw DC for the spell the fiend is trying to avoid. The fiend gains a +4 circumstance bonus on this check if it is not controlling the possessed creature or object at the time of the check. When possessing a creature, a fiend of possession can make this Hide check to protect the possessed creature from the full effects of alignmentbased spells such as holy smite. If the fiend makes a successful Hide check (against the save DC of the spell), the possessed creature takes damage appropriate to its actual alignment, but if the fiend fails the Hide check, the possessed creature is affected as if it were the fiend. Making this check is not an action; the fiend can do it in response to another creature's action (such as casting detect evil).	KEY:Fiend of Possession ~ Hide Presence																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Possession	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Possess Object	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiend of possession in ethereal form can possess an object on the Material Plane. The object must be at least Tiny and no larger than Huge. Magic items and attended items receive Will saving throws. Unattended nonmagical items are automatically possessed. A fiend of possession becomes part of the object it possesses, so it is no longer ethereal. The fiend is aware of what is going on around the object: It can see and hear up to 60 feet away as if using its normal senses (it does not gain blindsight). In any round in which it takes no other action (such as using a spell-like ability), it extends its senses to twice its normal range (120 feet). The fiend is vulnerable to spells that specifically affect outsiders or creatures of the fiend's alignment (such as holy word and holy smite, as well as chaos hammer or order 's wrath) and mindaffecting spells or effects, but it is unaffected by physical attacks or standard magical effects (such as fireball). Harming the object does not harm the fiend, although if the object is destroyed, the fiend is forced back into its ethereal form. While possessing an object, a fiend of possession can use any ability it has that requires no physical action, such as using a spelllike ability or telepathy. It cannot cast spells (since it can neither speak nor move), attack physically, or perform any other physical action, until it reaches a high enough level to make the possessed object perform these tasks for it.	KEY:Fiend of Possession ~ Possess Object																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Possession	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Curse	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a fiend of possession gains the ability to make a possessed item radiate a corrupt and befouling nature. Anyone touching the object must make a Will save or fall under the effect of a bestow curse spell. The affected creature does not know that the curse came from the item, and in fact might not know right away that he or she is affected by the curse. Nothing about the object's appearance suggests that it is possessed. The curse lasts until it is removed, even if the fiend vacates the object it possessed.	KEY:Fiend of Possession ~ Curse																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Possession	SOURCEPAGE:FF
Magic Item	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Also at 2nd level, a fiend of possession gains the ability to make a possessed weapon or armor function as a magic item. The fiend can bestow powers on the item with a value as an enhancement bonus of up to its class level, so a 3rd-level fiend of possession could make a sword a +3 weapon, a +2 keen weapon, or a +1 wounding weapon, for example. If the possessed item is already magical, the fiend can increase the powers on the item by the same amount-so a 5th-level fiend of possession could turn a +1 sword into a +1 vorpal sword, for example. When a fiend uses this power on a nonmagical item, the possessed item does not actually become magical. Detect magic does not reveal an aura on the item, though detect evil does. If a fiend possessing an item attempts to possess a creature that uses the item or keeps it on its person, the target's save DC increases by 1 for each day the possessed item has been on its person or in its use, to a maximum of +10. A character who makes a Search check (DC 25) while examining the possessed item can tell that there is "something strange" about it.	KEY:Fiend of Possession ~ Magic Item																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Possession	SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Control Object	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When possessing an object with some inherent mobility, a fiend of possession of at least 3rd level can control the object's movement. The fiend can cause a vehicle or similar object to move at a speed up to the fiend's own land speed in its corporeal form. Other moving parts-such as a clock's hands or a crossbow's firing mechanism-are under the fiend's control. Thus, a fiend could make a wagon steer toward a pedestrian, or roll out of a stable without a horse to pull it. It could make a crossbow cock and fire (but not aim or load itself ). Exerting control is itself a free action, though actually moving an object requires a move action.

Animate Object	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a fiend of possession gains the ability to force an object with no inherent moving parts to animate, effectively animating it as with the animate objects spell. See the description of animated objects in the Monster Manual. At this level, a fiend of possession can also possess (and animate) Gargantuan objects.	KEY:Fiend of Possession ~ Animate Object																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Possession	SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Possess Creature	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a fiend of possession gains the ability to possess creatures as well as objects. The fiend must be in ethereal form and adjacent to its target, and must use a standard action to attempt possession. A protection from evil spell or similar magic wards a creature against being possessed in this manner. An unprotected target must make a Will saving throw. Evil creatures take a -2 penalty on this saving throw, as do creatures that are engaged in an evil act at the time the possession attempt occurs (at the DM's discretion). If the saving throw is successful, that creature is immune to that fiend's possession attempts for one day. If the saving throw is failed, the creature is possessed, though it is not necessarily aware of this fact. A fiend possessing a creature becomes a part of the victim, so it is no longer ethereal. It cannot be targeted by spells or attacks separately from the victim, including attacks from ethereal creatures. Damage taken by the possessed creature has no effect on the fiend. If the victim dies, the fiend is forced back into its ethereal form. The fiend can sense anything the victim can, even including the benefits of blindsight or other exceptional senses the victim may have. At any time, the fiend of possession can communicate with the victim telepathically, projecting words in any language the victim understands directly into the victim's thoughts. The fiend is constantly aware of the victim's current thoughts. It can also choose to probe the creature's memories as well, but the victim is allowed a Will save. If this saving throw is successful, the fiend cannot probe that creature's thoughts for one day.

Ally or Enemy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a fiend of possession gains the ability to reward or punish a creature it is possessing. If the possessed creature is aware of the fiend's presence and willing to host the fiend, the fiend can bestow a +4 profane bonus on any of the creature's ability scores. This bonus lasts as long as the fiend wants it to: The fiend can retract it as a free action at any time, particularly if the possessed creature starts acting contrary to the fiend's wishes. Similarly, a fiend of possession can bestow a -4 profane penalty on any of the possessed creature's ability scores, usually when attempts to control the creature have failed or the creature contradicts the fiend's wishes. As with the bonus, the fiend can remove this penalty at any time, as a free action. Bestowing either a bonus or a penalty is a free action for the possessing fiend.

Possess Noncontinuous Object	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a fiend of possession can use its possess object ability to take control of an "object" more loosely defined: a pool of water, a cloud of dust, or a section of wall or floor. At this level, a fiend of possession can also possess (and animate) Colossal objects.	KEY:Fiend of Possession ~ Possess Noncontinuous Object																										SORTKEY:Class_Fiends_Of_Possession	SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Control Creature	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendOfPossessionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level, a fiend of possession gains the ability to exert direct control over a creature it is possessing. Attempting to establish control is a standard action for the fiend. The victim must make a Will saving throw each round until the fiend abandons the attempt, or the victim fails a saving throw and the fiend gains control, or the victim makes three consecutive successful saves, indicating that the fiend cannot control the victim that day (though it remains in possession of the victim). Each round of struggle, the victim can take only a single move or attack action. Once the fiend gains control, it automatically maintains it for a number of rounds equal to its class level (6) + its Charisma modifier, + 1 for each previous occasion on which it has controlled this host. When this time elapses, the fiend can attempt to reassert control or not, as it chooses. While in control of a victim, the fiend of possession has access to all the creature's abilities, skills, feats, and spell knowledge. The fiend now acts as though it is the creature in all respects, until it loses or relinquishes control. The fiend uses its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, but adopts all of the possessed creature's physical ability scores. It can make use of its own spell-like abilities as well. The fiend retains the creature's type, and is affected by spells and other effects as if it were the possessed creature except in regard to its alignment. For instance, a cornugon possessing the body of a wolf is subject to spells that affect animals, even though it is far more intelligent than a normal wolf. A balor possessing the body of a paladin is not subject to unholy blight, however, but is fully affected by holy smite. The fiend can choose whether the possessed creature retains awareness of its body's senses and actions, in which case it can mentally communicate with the fiend, or simply blacks out for the duration of the control.
