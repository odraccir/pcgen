Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HalfIllithidRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a half-illithid hits an opponent that is its own size or smaller with a tentacle attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it gets a hold, it attaches the tentacle to the opponent's head. After a successful grab, the half-illithid can try to attach its remaining tentacles with a single grapple check. The opponent can escape with a single successful grapple check or Escape Artist check, but the half-illithid gets a +2 circumstance bonus for every tentacle that was attached at the beginning of the opponent's turn.

An infected victim must make a saving throw each day thereafter or take another 1d2 points of Strength and Constitution damage.

Divine Conversion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HuecuvaRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cleric who becomes a huecuva loses access to the domains he had in life and replaces them with the Death and Evil domains. A cleric who previously was able to turn undead loses that ability and gains the ability to rebuke or command undead, like other evil clerics. A paladin who becomes a huecuva gains special abilities much like a fallen paladin who becomes a blackguard. See the information on fallen paladin blackguard abilities in the DUNGEONMASTER's Guide to determine the huecuva's special abilities.

Aversion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TiKhanaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ti-khanacreature creates a compulsion effect targeting one creature within 30 feet. The subject must succeed on a Will save (DC %1) or gain an aversion to snakes for 10 minutes. Affected subjects must stay at least 20 feet from any snake, yuan-ti, or tikhana, alive or dead; if already within 20 feet, they move away. A subject can overcome the compulsion by making another Will save (DC %1), but still suffers from deep anxiety. This anxiety causes a -4 penalty to Dexterity until the effect wears off or the subject is no longer within 20 feet of a snake, yuan-ti, or ti-khana. This ability is otherwise similar to antipathy as cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.|AversionDC	KEY:Ti-Khana ~ Aversion				DEFINE:AversionDC|0					BONUS:VAR|AversionDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|AversionDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Aversion)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Aversion									SOURCEPAGE:FF

The incubation period is 1d3 days, and the disease deals 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Additionally, each day that a victim takes Wisdom damage from the disease, he must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 wendigo's HD + wendigo's Cha modifier) or become overwhelmed with an insatiable hunger for the flesh of its own race. The victim stalks and tries to kill the closest member of its own race; if it does so, it feeds on the victim's body and then returns home with no memory of the tragic event. If a victim of this hunger is reduced to a Wisdom score of 0, he transforms into a wendigo immediately and races off into the night sky at such speed that his feet burn away into bloody, charred stumps.|DiseaseDC	KEY:Wendigo ~ Disease				DEFINE:DiseaseDC|0					BONUS:VAR|DiseaseDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|DiseaseDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Disease)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Disease									SOURCEPAGE:FF				
Maddening Whispers	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WendigoRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A wendigo may use its maddening whispers on any one target within 120 feet once per day. The wendigo may use this ability while wind walking. Only the chosen victim can hear the insane whispers and invitations of the wendigo. The victim must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 wendigo's HD + wendigo's Cha modifier, DC %1) or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Typically, a wendigo stalks a chosen victim for days, wearing down the victim's Wisdom score until it attacks and attempts to bring down its disease upon the poor soul. A wendigo will stop stalking a target that resists the maddening whispers for more than three days and fly off to seek easier prey.|MaddeningWhispersDC	KEY:Wendigo ~ Maddening Whispers				DEFINE:MaddeningWhispersDC|0					BONUS:VAR|MaddeningWhispersDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|MaddeningWhispersDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Maddening Whispers)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Maddening Whispers									SOURCEPAGE:FF				
Ravenous Bite	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WendigoRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A wendigo threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 18-20 when attacking with its bite, and deals triple damage on a successful critical hit. A wound resulting from a critical hit bleeds for an additional 3 points of damage per round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 6 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only by a successful Heal check (DC 10) or the application of any cure spell or other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or the like).

Corner of the Eye	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WendigoRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A wendigo that stalks a victim while wind walking always seems to lurk just at the corner of its chosen victim's field of vision.

Creeper Loyalty	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YellowMuskZombieRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Yellow musk zombies always act to protect and nurture the yellow musk creeper that created them.
