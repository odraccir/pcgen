Shadow Cloak	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DarkOnesSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Three times per day, a dark one can wrap itself in a cloak of shadows that grants it concealment from its foes. In shadows or darkness, the shadow cloak gives the creature nine-tenths concealment (40%% miss chance for attackers). In bright light, the shadow cloak provides only one-half concealment (20%% miss chance). Darkvision does not negate the dark one's concealment, since the shadow cloak is formed from magical darkness. Creatures that can see in magical darkness,such as devils, do not have a miss chance when striking a dark one.	KEY:Dark Ones ~ Shadow Cloak																											SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DarkOnesSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Anytime a dark one's target is denied a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a dark one, the dark one deals additional damage on a successful melee attack.

Languages	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EthergauntSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Ethergaunts communicate with each other using their own language, Khen-Zai, which cannot be learned by those who lack their unique anatomy. Most know a smattering of other languages-usually tongues plucked from the minds of enslaved envoys. Common additional languages include Common, Draconic, Dwarven, and Elven.

Enslave	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EthergauntSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Three times per day, an ethergaunt can attempt to enslave any one living creature within 30 feet. This ability functions similarly to a dominate monster spell (caster level 16th; Will save DC 13 for red, DC 16 for white, and DC 20 for black ethergaunts). An enslaved creature obeys the ethergaunt's telepathic commands to the letter. The subject can attempt a new Will save every day to break free. Otherwise, the ethergaunt's control is broken only by the death of either the ethergaunt or the enslaved creature, or by a remove curse or dispel magic effect, or if the ethergaunt travels more than 1 mile from the enslaved creature or travels to a different plane from the one its thrall is on. At any given time, an ethergaunt may have one slave per point of Charisma bonus (normally one slave for a red or white ethergaunt or two for a black, although exceptional individuals may be able to command more slaves).|EnslaveDC	KEY:Ethergaunt ~ Enslave				DEFINE:EnslaveDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EnslaveDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|EnslaveDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Enslave)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Enslave									SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Stupefying Gaze	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EthergauntSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An ethergaunt can open and close its vertically bisected mask as a free action, revealing a horrifically alien morass of facial organs and orifices. On its turn, the creature decides if it wants its mask open or closed. Anyone within 30 feet of an ethergaunt with an open mask who meets the creature's gaze must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 13 for red, DC 16 for white, and DC 20 for black ethergaunts) or immediately take 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ethergaunt's stupefying gaze for one day. Ethergaunts are immune to their own gaze attacks and to those of others of their kind.|StupefyingGazeDC	KEY:Ethergaunt ~ Stupefying Gaze				DEFINE:StupefyingGazeDC|0					BONUS:VAR|StupefyingGazeDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|StupefyingGazeDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Stupefying Gaze)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Stupefying Gaze									SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Immunity to Spell	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EthergauntSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Ethergaunts may choose to ignore the effects of arcane spells, just as if the spellcaster had failed to overcome spell resistance. They have no power over divine spells, having long ago rationalized divinity out of their racial philosophy. Though powerful, this ability is somewhat limited. It applies only to arcane spells of 2nd level or lower for red ethergaunts, 4th level or lower for white ethergaunts, and 6th level or lower for black ethergaunts.	KEY:Ethergaunt ~ Immunity to Spell																											SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Material Jaunt	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EthergauntSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Ethergaunts dwell on the Ethereal Plane. While in their natural state of etherealness, they can perceive but not affect creatures and objects on the Material Plane. However, an ethergaunt can transport itself from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a standard action. It can remain on the Material Plane for up to 1 round per Hit Die it possesses. At the end of this time, or when the ethergaunt chooses, it becomes ethereal again. An ethergaunt must remain on the Ethereal Plane for at least 1 hour after a material jaunt before it can use the ability again. Ethergaunts who wish to remain on the Material Plane for a longer time must use plane shift or similar magic. Most white and black ethergaunts know the plane shift spell and use it for this purpose.	KEY:Ethergaunt ~ Material Jaunt																											SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Total Vision	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EthergauntSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An ethergaunt's superdeveloped brain and countless facial sensory organs allow it to discern all objects within 40 feet, even through the mask that hides its face. An ethergaunt usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its total vision. A silence spell has no bearing upon an ethergaunt's total vision.

If in the area of a sunbeam or sunburst spell, a fensir must make a Fortitude save or be turned to stone, in addition to the normal effects of the spell.

Mirror Jump	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NerraSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Nerras can move through mirrored and reflective surfaces at will. This effect is similar to shadow walk, but the nerra travels along the Plane of Mirrors. As a standard action, the nerra must touch a mirror or other highly reflective surface. The nerra then exits from another mirror that is no farther than 1 mile away. If a nerra touches a regular mirror, the mirror jump happens automatically. A nerra can also touch a highly reflective surface, such as a polished metal shield or armor. This surface must be clear glass, a still pool of water, or shiny metal. There is a 30%% chance that the surface is reflective enough for the nerra to make the mirror jump. However, anerra can only enter a nonmirrored surface-it can return only through a normal mirror. If another mirror is not within the range of the mirror jump, the nerra must wander the Plane of Mirrors and exit through another random mirror portal.	KEY:Nerra ~ Mirror Jump																											SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Reflective Spell Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NerraSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A nerra has a special type of spell resistance that causes any targeted spell it successfully resists to bounce off and reflect back at the caster.

Alternatively, the abyssal ghoul has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its front claws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the ghoul is not considered grappled).

Blindsight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhoulAbyssalRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An abyssal ghoul is blind, but it maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature by using scent and vibration to ascertain its surroundings.

Drowning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AhuizotlRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an ahuizotl pins a grappled victim while in water of any depth, the ahuizotl holds its victim underwater. The victim can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. When this time limit is reached, it must make a Constitution check (DC 10) each round to continue holding its breath; each round the DC increases by 1.

Anyone who joins a band of bacchae in their debauchery, whether voluntarily or through the beguilement of the bacchae's spell-like abilities, must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1 per 3 bacchae engaged in the revel, to a maximum DC of 20 for a band of 30 bacchae) or lose all track of time and start carousing alongside the bacchae. A victim ensnared by the bacchae's debauchery will not willingly leave the mob. At the next sunrise, the victim must make a second Will save. If successful, the debauched character recovers his or her senses and may leave if he so chooses, although the bacchae are likely to begin the whole process all over again. If the debauched character fails the save, the character becomes a bacchae. A transformed character abandons her previous lifestyle, gains all the statistics and abilities of a bacchae, and fights against former allies as part of her bacchae mob.

Additionally, the animated body is not limited to single actions. Also, the animated body's bite attack can deliver the bhut's poison, but the bite is not itself a natural attack (-4 penalty on attack rolls). It deals only 1d3 points of damage, and it provokes an attack of opportunity. As long as the bhut inhabits the body, it is not affected by its earth vulnerability, nor does it gain the benefits of its augmented critical or dreadful appearance abilities. Bhuts make excellent use of their Bluff and Disguise skills in this state to make the animated body appear to be alive.

Each round thereafter that a creature remains impaled by a horn, it takes additional horn damage automatically and incurs a cumulative -1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. On the bonespear's turn in subsequent rounds, it attempts to drag its prey closer (see below). A single attack with a slashing weapon against a tendon (made as an attempt to sunder a weapon) that deals at least 15 points of damage severs a horn from its tendon. A creature impaled by a severed horn takes 1d6 points of damage per round automatically until the horn is removed. Removing a horn (a full-round action) deals 2d8 points of damage to the victim, but if the character removing the horn makes a successful Heal check (DC 20), this damage is reduced to 1d4 points.

The bonespear gains a +4 bonus on its drag check if it is set in its immobile stance. Against a Medium size victim, the bonespear's Strength modifier is +10, or +14 if it is set in its stance.

Column Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CaryatidColumnRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When at rest (not commanded, or waiting to fulfill a command), a caryatid column takes the form of a simple column of stone. This column is about 2 feet in diameter, and it extends up to the ceiling of the chamber or to a height of 25 feet, whichever is less. Unless commanded otherwise, a caryatid column remains in this form until attacked, and it even allows creatures to climb it (Climb check DC 15). A caryatid column in column form looks like a pillar in most respects. It does not radiate magic, and true seeing does not reveal its humanoid form. Careful examination of the column (Search check DC 25) reveals very faint and distorted lines that make the pillar resemble a woman with a sword. Anyone who successfully makes a Knowledge (architecture and engineering) check (DC 12) notes  that the column serves no structural purpose since it bears none of the ceiling's weight. A close examination of the top of the column (Search check DC 15) or a keen eye  (Spot check DC 20) shows that the column is not cemented or joined to the ceiling.

Magic Weapon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CaryatidColumnRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A magic weapon is incorporated into a caryatid column at the time of its creation. This weapon, usually a +2 bastard sword, functions in all respects like a normal magic weapon of its type, with one exception: Whenever it is out of the caryatid column's hands, it reverts to stone and becomes a nonmagical sculpture. Should the caryatid column then pick up the weapon, it regains its normal form and magical qualities. If a caryatid column needs both hands free, it can stow its weapon by simply pressing it against its side; the weapon then merges with the caryatid column's body and can be retrieved by the caryatid column as any character would draw a weapon.

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CenturyWormRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a century worm hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +54). If it gets a hold, it automatically deals bite damage and can attempt to swallow the foe. Thereafter, the century worm has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its bite to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the century worm is not considered grappled).

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CenturyWormRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A century worm can swallow a single creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +54), provided it already has that opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the century worm, the opponent takes 2d6+9 points of acid damage per round from the worm's stomach. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the century worm's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at least 40 points of damage to the stomach (AC 22) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A century worm's maw can hold 2 Large, 8 Mediumsize, 32 Small, or 128 Tiny or smaller opponents.	KEY:Century Worm ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Wriggling Progeny	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CenturyWormRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Characters trapped within a century worm's stomach must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 38) every round or take 1d8 points of Constitution damage as century worm larvae burrow through the victim's skin and make their way toward its heart. A successful save staves off Constitution damage for that round only. When a victim's Constitution reaches 0, the victim dies and a single century worm larva digs into its flesh and attaches itself to the corpse's spine. The larva can be destroyed by a remove disease spell. If it is not destroyed, a new century worm begins to grow inside the body. This larval form begins as a Tiny creature with 20 hit points and grows one size category every 20 years (gaining another 80 hit points for every size change). When its size is the same as the size of its host body, the worm bursts forth from within the body. It continues to feed on the remains of the body until, after 100 years, it reaches Gargantuan size and becomes a fully formed century worm. Bodies currently serving as incubators for century worm larvae cannot be returned to life by any means.	KEY:Century Worm ~ Wriggling Progeny																											SOURCEPAGE:FF

If it gets a hold, it automatically hits with its bite, dealing 1d6+3 points of damage and 2d4 points of Strength damage.

Shadow Strand	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DarkweaverRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At will, a darkweaver can create an aura of weblike, supernatural, semisolid shadow that emanates outward from it in a 60-foot spread. A darkweaver can see normally through the shadow strands, but other creatures have great difficulty doing so. Each full 5 feet of shadow strands grants one-quarter concealment. Thus, a creature in the shadow strands 10 feet away from another creature would have one-half concealment, and a creature in the shadow strands 20 feet away would have total concealment. A creature in the shadow strands has no concealment from creatures within 5 feet. Creatures with darkvision suffer these effects, and the shadow strands even baffle blindsight, but true seeing allows a creature to see normally through them. Any creature that enters this area can freely move toward the darkweaver, but any attempt to move in any other direction is resisted by the semisolid shadow strands. A creature attempting to move in such a fashion must make a Strength check or an Escape Artist check; the creature can move away from the darkweaver 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. If a creature is adjacent to the darkweaver (within 5 feet), it can move freely so long as it remains adjacent to the darkweaver. A creature protected by a freedom of movement spell is immune to the constraining effects of the shadow strands. The darkweaver can move about as it wishes and bring the area of shadow strands with it. Creatures are not affected by the darkweaver's moving the strands, but the direction toward the darkweaver will likely change. Creatures within the strands do not need to guess in which direction the darkweaver lies; it becomes immediately obvious when they try to move away and the shadow strands snarl and twist to block all other routes. When a creature without freedom of movement attempts to move against the strands, the darkweaver is immediately aware of its location even if it cannot see the creature due to invisibility. Darkweavers are immune to other darkweavers' shadow strands and can see through them.	KEY:Darkweaver ~ Shadow Strand																											SOURCEPAGE:FF

The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. The darkweaver can shadow jump up to a total of 320 feet per day; this amount can be split up among many jumps in 10-foot increments. Thus, a darkweaver that shadow jumps 35 feet would use up 40 feet of its shadow jump limit for the day.

Consume	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemonMaurezhiRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a maurezhi slays a sentient living creature (Int 3 or higher) and consumes the body, it gains additional power from this grisly food. It must begin eating the corpse within 10 minutes of its death and requires 30 minutes to complete the consumption. If the maurezhi is interrupted during this process, it can't completely consume the corpse or gain the benefits. A creature that has been consumed by a maurezhi cannot be restored to life through any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. A wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a consumed victim to life, but there is a 50%% chance that even such powerful magic will fail. There is no limit to the number of corpses a maurezhi can consume in this fashion, but it only advances (see below) by devouring the corpses of humanoids whose Hit Dice or levels are at least half its current Hit Dice. For example, a maurezhi of 13 Hit Dice can only advance by devouring the corpse of a character of at least 7th level. For each suitable humanoid corpse a maurezhi consumes,its Hit Dice, natural armor bonus, Strength, Intelligence, and base attack bonus each increase by +1. Its base saving throw bonuses improve according to its new Hit Dice. It gains additional skill points equal to 8 + its Intelligence modifier, and it spends these additional points on skills possessed by its victim (all of which are treated as class skills for the maurezhi). If the added Hit Die brings the maurezhi's total HD to a multiple of four, it gains a new feat as well, which it can choose from among the feats its previous victims had, assuming that it meets the prerequisites. In addition, the maurezhi gains access to the memories of the creature it has consumed, can speak any language that creature knew, and can assume that creature's form (see below). The maurezhi can reach a maximum of 20 Hit Dice through advancement. Its damage reduction, spell resistance, and Challenge Rating improve based on its Hit Dice, as shown on the table below.&nl;Maurezhi Total HD - Damage Reduction - Spell Resistance - CR&nl;5-7 - 10/Good - 19 - 9&nl;8-9 - 15/Good - 20 - 10&nl;10-14 - 15/Good and Cold Iron - 21 - 11&nl;15-19 - 15/Good and Cold Iron - 22 - 12&nl;20 - 20/Magic and Good and Cold Iron - 23 - 13	KEY:Demon (Maurezhi) ~ Consume				DEFINE:MaurezhiConsumeLVL|0					BONUS:VAR|MaurezhiConsumeLVL|OutsiderLVL	BONUS:MISC|SR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,8	BONUS:MISC|SR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,10	BONUS:MISC|SR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,15	BONUS:MISC|SR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,20					BONUS:MISC|CR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,8	BONUS:MISC|CR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,10	BONUS:MISC|CR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,15	BONUS:MISC|CR|1|PREVARGTEQ:MaurezhiConsumeLVL,20	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|MaurezhiConsumeLVL-2|TYPE=NaturalArmor	BONUS:STAT|INT,STR|MaurezhiConsumeLVL-5				SOURCEPAGE:FF

When an ethereal ooze manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ooze cannot harm material opponents except by using its etherealize ability. A manifested ooze remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ooze can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ethereal ooze's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not foes on the Ethereal Plane.

While studying the victim, the shadow giant can undertake other actions so long as its attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails its Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 shadow giant's HD + shadow giant's Int modifier) against the death effect, it dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim becomes helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round for each 2 HD of the shadow giant. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the shadow giant has completed the 3 rounds of study, it must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

Every Constitution point lost in this fashion heals the golem 5 hit points. (The golem usually restores its hit points to maximum before filling its reservoirs so that it can remain at full strength.) Both the golem and the victim must remain motionless.

Blood Dependency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GolemBloodGolemOfHextorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Because a blood golem constantly leaks its own vital fluid, it must absorb blood from other creatures to continue functioning. The golem loses 5 hit points per day, regardless whether it is engaged in physical activity or merely stands motionless for the entire day. If the golem's armor is removed or destroyed, this loss increases to 10 hit points per day. If the golem reaches 0 hit points from blood leakage, it is destroyed, leaving only its armor.

Blood Reservoir	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GolemBloodGolemOfHextorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The reservoirs in the golem's armor hold blood equivalent to 20 points of Constitution, which is about as much as the capacity of two average human bodies.

A spell with the chaotic or evil descriptor (such as chaos hammer or unholy blight) breaks any slow effect on the golem and cures 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. It is fully affected by spells with the law or good descriptor, unless its construct traits make it immune to the spell's effects (it cannot be blinded by a holy aura, for example, because that effect allows a Fortitude save). As an extraplanar creature, a demonflesh golem on the Material Plane can be driven back to its home plane by a dispel evil or dispel chaos spell (as well as by holy word or dictum), but it is not affected by banishment or dismissal since they are not good or lawful spells.

A cold effect that deals more than 20 points of damage (after overcoming its cold resistance) slows it (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HullathoinRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a hullathoin hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a tentacle attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +26). Thereafter, the hullathoin has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tentacle to hold the foe (see improved grapple, below). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals tentacle damage. It can also attempt to pin its opponent.

A tendril draws a stuck opponent 10 feet closer in each subsequent round (no attack of opportunity) unless the opponent breaks free, which requires an Escape Artist check (DC 25) or a Strength check (DC 26). An ironmaw can draw in a creature within 15 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in that round. An ironmaw can draw a creature into its space and attempt to engulf it as well.

Vile Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KaortiRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A kaorti can infuse any living creature with otherworldly essence from the Far Realm, permanently transforming the target into a mockery of its previous form. This process takes 8 hours, during which time the kaorti's jaws must be locked onto the victim, who must be either willing or helpless for the duration. After 8 hours, the victim must make a Fortitude save (DC %1). Failure indicates that the victim transforms into a kaorti (if the victim was a humanoid), or into a kaorti thrall. If the victim succeeds at the save, the kaorti can attempt the transformation again; each additional attempt to transform a victim increases the save DC by +1. Creatures transformed into kaortis retain any class abilities and modify their ability scores as follows: Str -4, Dex +4, Int +4, Cha +6. They become neutral evil and embrace the racial ethos of the kaortis. They gain all of the other abilities and disadvantages of a standard kaorti. This transformation is the only way the kaorti can propagate their kind. A victim transformed into a kaorti thrall gains the fiendish creature template, except that instead of gaining the smite good special attack, it gains the ability to cast true strike on itself once per day.|VileTransformationDC	KEY:Kaorti ~ Vile Transformation				DEFINE:VileTransformationDC|0					BONUS:VAR|VileTransformationDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|VileTransformationDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Vile Transformation)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Vile Transformation									SOURCEPAGE:FF

If a kaorti is rendered unconscious through the accumulation of subdual damage (from this ability or from any other source), the Material Plane environs begin to deal normal damage at the same rate (Fort save negates; save DC continues to increase per check as stated above).

It can form either arm into any melee weapon of up to Medium-size. It must fuse and form both its arms to mimic a weapon of Large size or a double weapon. A keeper cannot use its arms to create melee weapons of a size larger than it could normally wield. A mimicked weapon has all the properties of a standard weapon of that type. A keeper's attacks with its mimicked weapons are treated as natural attacks; thus, keepers do not incur the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons, cannot be disarmed, and do not gain iterative attacks with their mimicked weapons.

Body Switch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KeeperRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A keeper's hive mind and its unique mental link to other keepers grants it a supernatural ability to exchange places with any other living keeper within 500 feet. As a standard action, a keeper can use teleport without error to reach the exact location of another keeper, instantaneously teleporting the other keeper away and effectively switching positions with that keeper.

Dissolution	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KeeperRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a keeper is captured, pinned, or held helpless, it has 10 rounds to free itself or be freed by another creature. If it is not freed before that time, it dissolves into a 5-foot-wide puddle of the same contact poison the keepers spit. The puddle and any poison taken from it evaporate in 4 rounds-except that a Craft (poisonmaking) check (DC 20) made during that time will preserve enough poison from the puddle for one dose of keeper poison (see the sidebar for statistics). A keeper that dies also dissolves into a puddle of poison. Any creature that touches the keeper as it dissolves (such as with a natural attack that dealt the death blow) or that touches a puddle of poison before it evaporates must make Fortitude saving throws to avoid the poison's effects.

Once inside the lucent worm, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d4 points of acid damage per round from the lucent worm's stomach. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the lucent worm's maw, from where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at least 30 points of damage to the stomach (AC 19) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

Once inside the octopus tree, the opponent takes 2d6+9 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d4 points of acid damage per round from the plant's internal cavity. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the internal cavity and return to the octopus tree's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at least 20 points of damage to the internal cavity (AC 22) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, rapid growth closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. An octopus tree's cavity can hold 1 Large, 4 Medium-size, or 16 Small or smaller opponents.	KEY:Octopus Tree ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:FF

Constrict Ship	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SeaDrakeRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Instead of crushing a ship with its tail, a sea drake can wrap its serpentine body around all but the largest ships and crush them or drag them below the waves automatically. This can be done to a rowboat (1 round), keelboats (3 rounds), longships (5 rounds), and sailing ships (10 rounds). Warships and galleys are too large for a sea drake to affect in this way.

The ship's pilot must make a Reflex saving throw (DC %1) after each hit to keep the vessel from being breached and sinking in 1d10 minutes. Apply a modifier to the DC based on the type of ship: rowboat +4, keelboat +2, sailing ship or longship +0, warship -3, galley -5. Regardless of the ship's saving throw result, characters aboard the ship must make Reflex saving throws (DC %1); a successful save means the character takes 1d4 points of damage; on a failed save, a character on deck is hurled overboard and a character belowdecks takes 2d4 points of damage.|CrushingBlowDC	KEY:Sea Drake ~ Crushing Blow				DEFINE:CrushingBlowDC|0					BONUS:VAR|CrushingBlowDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|CrushingBlowDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Crushing Blow)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Crushing Blow									SOURCEPAGE:FF	
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SeaDrakeRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A sea drake can swallow whole any creature at least one size category smaller than itself that it successfully attacks with its bite while in the water. First the sea drake must hold the creature in its mouth with a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +36). A second successful grapple check on the following round means the creature is swallowed whole. Once inside the sea drake, the creature must make Swim checks (DC 15) every round as if it was in turbulent water. Success means it takes 1d3 points of subdual damage but can attack the sea drake's insides; failure means it takes 1d6 points of subdual damage and it must make another Swim check immediately to avoid drowning. (The creature cannot attack when avoiding drowning.) A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the sea drake's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at least 35 points of damage to the stomach (AC 20) in this way causes the sea drake to disgorge the entire contents of its stomach. A sea drake's stomach can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium-size, or 16 Small or smaller opponents.	KEY:Sea Drake ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:FF

Shadow Curse	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ShadarKaiRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Plane of Shadow exerts a tremendous pull on shadar-kai's soul, which is only tenuously connected to its mortal body. Any time a shadar-kai is stunned, dazed, staggered, or unconscious (other than from natural sleep), the shadow fey must make a Will save (DC 15) or lose a portion of her soul to the Plane of Shadow. The shadar-kai must also attempt a save any time she removes a gal-ralan, if she has one (see Shadar-Kai Items, below). A shadar-kai with a damaged soul gains one negative level that cannot be removed until she restores her soul completely. If exposed to another event that requires a save against the shadow curse, a shadar-kai may gain additional negative levels. A shadar-kai on the Plane of Shadow can transfix her soul to her body again with a greater restoration spell. A shadar-kai on the Material Plane (or elsewhere) must use a wish or miracle spell to restore her soul. A shadar-kai afflicted with the shadow curse cannot be raised from the dead or resurrected, and cannot gain experience. The touch of the shadow curse galls a shadar-kai, filling her heart with an icy emptiness that eventually drives all but the most determined individuals to capitulate and leave the Material Plane altogether. A shadar-kai who goes to the Plane of Shadow and remains there ameliorates the effects of the shadow curse and suffers no ill effects. However, if she leaves the Plane of Shadow without restoring her soul, she suffers the effects of the shadow curse until she returns to the Plane of Shadow or restores her soul.

Necromantic Acid	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UlgurstastaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Someone swallowed by an ulgurstasta is in deep trouble-the creature feeds on raw life and transforms its victims into animated skeletons that the ulgurstasta can later regurgitate. A swallowed victim takes 1d8 points of Constitution drain each round from the necromantic acid inside the creature.

For 1d6 rounds after being vomited up, these skeletons are covered with necromantic acid. They deal 1 point of Constitution drain with each successful attack in addition to other damage dealt.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UlgurstastaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An ulgurstasta can swallow a single creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +29), provided it already has that opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the ulgurstasta, the opponent is bathed in necromantic acid (see above). A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the ulgurstasta's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at least 25 points of damage to the stomach (AC 14) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. An ulgurstasta's maw can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller opponents.	KEY:Ulgurstasta ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:FF

When the creature is angered, the tendrils extend to their full range and whip about in a frenzy. This storm of tendrils renders an ulgurstasta immune to Small nonmagical ranged weapons such as arrows and deals 1d12 points of slashing damage per round to any creature within 40 feet of the ulgurstasta.

Victims of this attack are tossed inside the wicker man's chest cavity. The wicker man deals no damage to foes thus encaged unless it has been set aflame (see Flammable Body, below). An encaged foe can force its way out with a successful opposed grapple check (grapple bonus +26). An encaged victim can also cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 20 points of damage (AC 14), or with a successful Escape Artist check (DC 20). If a creature cuts its way out, the wicker reknits; another encaged opponent must cut its own way out.

Flaming Body	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WickerManRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When exposed to fire, a wicker man becomes sheathed in flames.

Treat this effect as a burst that continually radiates from the creature. Anyone touched by a flaming wicker man must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %1) or take 2d6 points of fire damage. Foes grappling with a flaming wicker man take 4d6 points of fire damage, and foes encaged within a wicker man while it is flaming take 6d6 points of fire damage each round. (Thus, a foe encaged within a flaming wicker man that attempts escape by grappling would take 6d6 points of fire damage on the wicker man's initiative count and another 4d6 points of fire damage when the foe makes a grapple attempt to escape on its initiative count.) A wicker man set afire flames for 10 minutes.

Creatures under the yellow musk creeper's compulsion can take no actions other than moving to enter the plant's space. (The creeper does not oppose these attempts, of course.) Affected creatures do anything they can to comply with the compulsion and even attack companions who seek to restrain them.

Ordinarily, the host regains 1 lost point of Intelligence each night, just before the cerebral hood drains a new point, keeping the host at an equilibrium point of -1 to its base Intelligence. When the cerebral hood uses its mind blast, however, it deals extra Intelligence damage, so overuse of that special attack can eventually destroy the host's mind.

Blindsight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SymbiontCerebralHoodRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cerebral hood is blind, but its entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration. This ability enables it to discern objects and creatures within 60 feet. The cerebral hood usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight. A cerebral hood attached to a host shares its sensory input with the host, conferring blindsight on the host.

When attached to a host, the psionic sinew extends this field of force to cover the host creature as well. Inertial armor entails no armor check penalty, speed reduction, or arcane spell failure chance. Because it is composed of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

Infect	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SymbiontGutwormRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Gutworm eggs are often found in the polluted water of the Abyss and infect creatures that drink the water. A purify water spell does not remove the eggs from the water, although they die if left in pure water for one day. Once inside a host, the eggs hatch in 1d4 hours, and the spawn set about devouring one another until only one remains. A remove disease spell cast on the host kills a gutworm, but the host takes 4d6 points of damage from the creature's death throes. A creature with a gutworm must eat twice as much food as it normally requires each day, and must start making daily Constitution checks after only one day without food (instead of the normal three days). In addition, the host creature is fatigued after 8 hours of activity and takes a -4 penalty on the following checks and saves: Swim checks to resist subdual damage; Constitution checks to continue running, to avoid subdual damage from a forced march, to hold its breath, or to avoid subdual damage from starvation or thirst; and Fortitude saves to avoid subdual damage from hot or cold environments, or to resist damage from oxygen deprivation.

This face looks corporeal and fleshy, but it is actually the visage's incorporeal form. When manifesting a visage, the ghostly visage is susceptible to attacks separate from its host. Attacks that miss the visage because of its incorporeal nature (including attacks from nonmagic weapons as well as attacks that are foiled by the 50%% chance to ignore damage) target the host instead. For attacks that require attack rolls, if the attack roll exceeds the AC of the host, the host takes damage instead of the visage.
