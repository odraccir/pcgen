Boost Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:The saving throw Difficulty Class (DC) of a boosted spell-like ability is increased by +2. Each of a creature's spell-like abilities can be boosted three times per day, though the feat does not allowthe creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a succubus chooses to boost its suggestion ability, it can use a boosted suggestion up to three times that day. Thereafter, it could use its suggestion ability again normally (since it can use suggestion at will), or it could boost another of its spell-like abilities, such as charmmonster. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spelllike abilities three additional times per day.

Boost Spell Resistance	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES							PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE															DESC:If the character already has innate spell resistance, he gains a +2 profane bonus to his existing spell resistance score.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoVD	BONUS:MISC|SR|2|TYPE=Profane	
Corrupt Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES							PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE															DESC:This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage is unholy damage. For example, a corrupted fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard deals 6d6 points of damage: 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of unholy damage. Thus, creatures immune to fire still potentially take 3d6 points of damage. The corrupted spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE														SOURCEPAGE:BoVD	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	
Corrupt Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES							PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE															DESC:This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell-like ability. Furthermore, if the spell-like ability deals damage, half of that damage (rounded down) is unholy damage. For example, if a corrupted fireball from a pit fiend deals a total of 35 points of damage, half of that amount (18 points) is fire damage and the other half (17 points) is unholy damage.Nonevil creatures immune to fire still take the 17 points of unholy damage. Each of a creature's spell-like abilities can be corrupted three times per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a pit fiend chooses to corrupt its fireball ability, it can use a corrupted fireball up to three times that day. Thereafter, it could use its fireball ability again normally (since it can use fireball at will), or it could corrupt another of its spell-like abilities, such as meteor swarm.

Empower Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell-like ability are increased by one-half. An empowered spell-like ability deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so on as appropriate. For example, a night hag's empowered magic missile deals one and one-half times normal damage (roll 1d4+1 and multiply the result by 1.5 for each missile). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected. Each of a creature's spell-like abilities can be empowered twice per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a night hag chooses to empower its magic missile ability, it can use an empowered magic missile up to two times that day. Thereafter, it could use its magic missile ability again normally (since it can use magic missile at will), or it could corrupt another of its spell-like abilities, such as sleep.

Mortalbane	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:A mortalbane ability is a damaging spell-like ability that deals 2d6 points of additional damage when used against living nonoutsiders, but only half damage (rounded down) against outsiders, undead, and constructs. For example, if a mortalbane cone of cold froma gelugon would normally deal 45 points of damage, it actually deals 45 + 2d6 points of damage to a humanoid, but only 22 points of damage to a night hag. Creatures immune to cold-regardless of their type-still take no damage from a mortalbane cone of cold. Mortalbane can be applied to each of a creature's spell-like abilities five times per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a gelugon chooses to apply Mortalbane to its cone of cold ability, it can use a mortalbane cone of cold up to five times that day. Thereafter, it could use its cone of cold ability again normally (since it can use cone of cold at will). Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities five additional times per day.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE														SOURCEPAGE:BoVD		
Poison Immunity	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:The character is immune to one specific poison (chosen by the DMor the character's player), whether available as a blade poison, the venom of a specific creature, or one other toxin. The character also gains a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against other poisons. Special: A character may take this feat multiple times, choosing a different poison each time. The +1 bonus against other poisons doesn't stack with itself, because the circumstances of each poison immunity are essentially the same.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE											BONUS:VAR|ResistanceToPoison|1|TYPE=Circumstance			SOURCEPAGE:BoVD	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Resistance to Poison	
Quicken Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action-including the use of another spell-like ability-in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round. A spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened. Each of a creature's spell-like abilities can be quickened only once per day, and the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a demon chooses to quicken its darkness ability, it cannot use quickened darkness again the same day, though it could use its darkness ability again normally (since it can use darkness at will), or it could quicken another of its spell-like abilities, such as desecrate. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities one additional time per day.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE														SOURCEPAGE:BoVD

Violate Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES							PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE															DESC:This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage dealt is vile damage. For example, a violated lightning bolt cast by an 8th-level wizard deals 8d6 points of damage: 4d6 points of electricity damage and 4d6 points of vile electricity damage (but creatures immune to electricity take no damage). A violated spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoVD	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	
Violate Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell-like ability. Furthermore, if the spell-like ability deals damage, half of that damage (rounded down) is vile damage. For example, if a violated lightning bolt from a cornugon deals a total of 35 points of damage, half of that amount (18 points) is electricity damage and the other half (17 points) is vile damage. Creatures immune to electricity take no damage from a violated lightning bolt. Each of a creature's spell-like abilities can be violated twice per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a cornugon chooses to violate its lightning bolt ability, it can use a violated lightning bolt up to two times that day. Thereafter, it could use its lightning bolt ability again normally once (since it can use lightning bolt three times per day), or it could violate another of its spell-like abilities, such as fireball. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities two additional times per day.
