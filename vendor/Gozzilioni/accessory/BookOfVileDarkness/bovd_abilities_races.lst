Burrow into Flesh	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VaatRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If the vaath has reduced its prey's Dexterity to 0 or established a hold on it, the vaath's mouth-ended tendril burrows into the creature's flesh. The tiny mouth chews its way through the victim, dealing 1d6 points of damage per round. After 1d4+1 rounds of burrowing, the tendril reaches a vital organ. Unless the vaath is killed or the victim receives healing, death comes 1d6+4 minutes later. Most victims survive long enough to watch their own intestines and organs disappear into the vaath's hungry maw.	KEY:Vaat ~ Burrow into Flesh																											SOURCEPAGE:BoVD

Telepathic Sensory Conduit	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VaatRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The vaath's only supernatural ability comes into play when its mouth-tendril has burrowed deep within its prey. When the vaath begins savoring the meat and organs of the creature, it telepathically transmits the sensation of taste (and its own enjoyment of it) to all within 20 feet-including the victim. All creatures are allowed a Will saving throw (DC %1) against this mind-affecting effect. Creatures that fail their saves take 1 point of Wisdom drain due to the horrific effect the devouring has on one's sanity. Victims that fail the Will save take 1d6 points of Wisdom drain, but that only matters if the victim survives. Creatures that regularly feed on the type of creature being devoured are immune to this effect. But no creature, not even another vaath, is immune to the horror of experiencing what its own entrails taste like.
