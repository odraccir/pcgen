Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Apostles of peace gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect them (such as a Ring of Protection or Bracers of Armor). An apostle of peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of peace spells or use any of his supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace has the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an apostle with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the apostle of peace's Wisdom modifier. When the apostle of peace gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 2nd-level spells for a 2nd-level apostle), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The apostle of peace's spell list appears below. An apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does. To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace, add the character's apostle levels to one-half of his caster levels in other spellcasting classes.

Spontaneous Casting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the apostle did not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can "lose" any prepared apostle spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

Turn Undead	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace can turn undead as a good cleric of his apostle of peace level would.

Pacifying Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic, using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target, such as fear or rage.

Censure Fiends	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils, and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a Charisma check for the apostle and consult Table 8-9 in the Player's Handbook, using the apostle's character level to determine the most powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6 + the apostle of peace's level + his Charisma modifier for censuring damage. Using both the apostle's character level and his class level in this manner means that he is more likely to affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle's holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle of peace attacks a censured fiend, the stunning ends immediately and the fiend can act normally on its next turn. If the apostle of peace's character level is at least twice the fiend's Hit Dice, he banishes the affected fiend back to its home plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. These attempts are separate from any attempts to turn undead.

Defensive Stance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DefenderOfSealtielClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When he needs to, a defender of Sealtiel can become a stalwart bastion of defense. In this defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender of Sealtiel's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position, such as Move Silently or Jump. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level. Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action. (A defender can't, for example, use the stance when struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution.)

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmissaryOfBarachielClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An emissary of Barachiel has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast an emissary of Barachiel spell, the emissary must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an emissary with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Emissary of Barachiel bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the emissary's Charisma modifier. When the emissary gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level emissary of Barachiel), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The emissary's spell list appears below. An emissary of Barachiel casts spells just as a bard does, except that his spells are divine and not arcane.

Calling	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmissaryOfBarachielClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An emissary of Barachiel's most fundamental ability is the power to issue a celestial call, stirring the conscience of those who hear it. An emissary can use this ability once per day per class level, spending a full-round action to issue the call. Humanoid creatures within 30 feet of the emissary are potentially affected. The emissary makes a Diplomacy check, and the result is the DC for affected creatures' Will saving throws. Creatures that fail their saves suffer effects that depend on their alignment, as tables indicate. Using any manifestation of the calling class ability requires the use of the Words of Creation and deals 3d4 points of nonlethal damage to the emissary. Calling is an Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting] effect.

Convert	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmissaryOfBarachielClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 3rd-level emissary of Barachiel can use his calling ability to facilitate actual conversion of nongood humanoids. Doing so counts as a use of the calling class ability (see above) for the day, and the initial effects of the calling are the same-except that the emissary takes 5d4 points of nonlethal damage instead of 3d4. When the initial effects are over, however, all creatures that were subject to any effect of the calling (except lawful good creatures) must make another saving throw. Creatures who fail begin acting as though their alignment were one step closer to good. Lawful evil creatures act lawful neutral, neutral evil creatures act neutral, and chaotic evil creatures act chaotic neutral. Lawful neutral and neutral good creatures act lawful good. True neutral and chaotic good creatures act neutral good, and chaotic neutral creatures act chaotic good. Creatures affected by this temporary alignment shift can make new saving throws each day for a total of seven days. If the emissary is not present at the time a creature makes its save, it receives a +1 circumstance bonus on the saving throw, and this bonus increases by 1 for each additional saving throw for which the emissary is not present. During these seven days, an affected creature is immune to any other conversion effect, from the same emissary or a different one. During this time, the alignment shift can be reversed with a break enchantment spell, but the caster must succeed on a caster level check against a DC equal to the emissary's original Diplomacy check result. Also during this time, an atonement spell can make the alignment shift permanent, preventing the creature from making any additional saving throws. If a creature fails seven saving throws after the initial saving throw against the calling, the alignment change is permanent. At this point, the creature can change alignment again, either through another conversion effect, or voluntarily (in a gradual manner, as alignment change normally works-the creature cannot simply decide to be evil again).

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SlayerOfDomielClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A slayer of Domiel has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a slayer of Domiel spell, the slayer must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a slayer of Domiel with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Slayer of Domiel bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the slayer's Wisdom modifier. When the slayer of Domiel gets 0 spells of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st level slayer of Domiel), she gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The slayer of Domiel's spell list appears below. A slayer of Domiel prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a slayer cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

She must succeed on a melee touch attack against the target. When she touches, she rolls 1d6 per slayer level. If the total at least equals the target's current hit points, it dies. This is a death effect, and it has no effect on nonevil creatures. A slayer of Domiel can use this ability more often as she increases in levels, as shown on Table 5-17.

Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SlayerOfDomielClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a slayer of Domiel can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time a slayer's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the slayer's attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and an additional 1d6 at every two slayer levels thereafter (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). Should a slayer of Domiel score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a slayer of Domiel can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the sneak attack. A slayer of Domiel can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer of Domiel cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If a slayer of Domiel gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.

The stalker can detect evil opponents within 30 feet by their scent of evil. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. A strong aura of evil (an evil outsider or evil cleric of 5-10 HD, an evil elemental or undead of 10-21 HD, an evil creature of 25-54 HD, or an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of 10-21) can be detected at twice these ranges.

The vassal of Bahamut gains a bonus equal to his class level on all Charisma-based skill checks made against dragons and dragon-type creatures (such as wyverns).

Platinum Armor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vassal of Bahamut is granted the ability to create platinum scale mail. The vassal starts with scales from a slain juvenile (or older) red dragon and works them for 2 days per character level. During this time, the vassal must not engage in any other activities other than eating and sleeping. At the end of this period, the red dragon scales transform into glistening platinum scales. The finished masterwork suit of armor weighs 25 pounds and confers a +8 armor bonus. Its other properties are as a masterwork chain shirt (+4 max Dex bonus, -1 armor check penalty, 20%% arcane spell failure chance, no speed Reduction). Only the vassal of Bahamut may wear the platinum armor, which instantly corrodes and turns to powder if donned by another creature. The vassal can replace a lost suit using scales from a slain juvenile (or older) red dragon, as noted above, but can craft no more than one such suit at a time. The vassal's platinum armor may be enhanced using standard item creation feats.	KEY:Vassal of Bahamut ~ Platinum Armor																										SORTKEY:Class_Vassal_Of_Bahamut	SOURCEPAGE:ExD

Shared Trove	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, a vassal of Bahamut receives a modest lump sum reward for his loyal service. The reward magically appears before the vassal-a mound of platinum coins delivered straight from Bahamut's celestial treasure vault. The number of platinum pieces equals 100 x the vassal of Bahamut's character level. The vassal may spend the money more or less as he sees fit, provided the expenditure serves a good or righteous cause. If the money is spent frivolously or unwisely, Bahamut sends a loyal representative (usually a gold dragon in an alternate form) to demand repayment. Spending the money to improve one's personal equipment is neither frivolous nor unwise.	KEY:Vassal of Bahamut ~ Shared Trove																										SORTKEY:Class_Vassal_Of_Bahamut	SOURCEPAGE:ExD	
Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a vassal of Bahamut gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the vassal must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a vassal with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Vassal of Bahamut bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the vassal's Wisdom bonus. When the vassal gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 2nd-level vassal of Bahamut), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell. The vassal of Bahamut's spell list appears below. A vassal of Bahamut prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a vassal of bahamut cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Dragonwrack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Evil dragons that strike a vassal of Bahamut or are struck by him suffer grievous wounds. At 4th level, a vassal of Bahamut deals +2d6 points of damage with each successful melee attack made against an evil creature of the dragon type. Furthermore, any such creature that strikes the vassal with a natural weapon or melee weapon takes 1d6 points of damage. In both cases, half of the extra damage is permanent hit point drain. A dragon that survives a battle against a vassal of Bahamut often bears terrible scars from the permanent drain of hit points. Only a wish or miracle spell can restore hit points drained permanently by a vassal's dragonwrack ability. At 7th level, the vassal deals +3d6 points of damage to evil dragons, and a dragon that strikes the vassal takes 1d6 points of damage. Again, in both cases, half of this damage is permanent drain. At 10th level, the damage increases to +4d6 points and 2d6 points, respectively.

Bonus Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WonderworkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:For each level of wonderworker that a spellcasting character attains, he gains bonus spells to the number of spells per day he normally casts. These bonus spells can be added to whatever levels of spells the wonderworker can currently cast, but no more than one can be added to the character's highest current spell level. Arcane spellcasters (bards, sorcerers, and wizards) receive fewer bonus spells than divine spellcasters (clerics and druids), as shown on the table above. For example, a 9th-level cleric who takes a single level in wonderworker can give himself one bonus 5th-level spell (his highest as a 9th-level cleric), and one bonus spell in one other level, 0 through 4th. A 9thlevel wizard who takes a level in wonderworker gains only one bonus spell, which she can give herself in any level, 0 through 5th. A psion who adopts the wonderworker class receives bonus power Points/day equal to one-half of the sum ofhis psion level and his wonderworker level. A psychic warrior/wonderworker receives bonus power points/day equal to one-third of the sum of her psychic warrior level and her wonderworker level. If a wonderworker has two spellcasting or psionic classes already, he must give the bonus spell or power points to a class in which he can cast at least 3rd-level spells or manifest at least 3rd-level powers. If more than one class meets that requirement, he must choose which previous class gains the bonus. He cannot split bonus spells or power points between two different spellcasting or psionic classes. For example, a 5th-level cleric/5th-level wizard takes one level of wonderworker. He can either take 2 bonus cleric spells or 1 bonus wizard spell, but he cannot take 1 of each. Once a wonderworker has chosen how to apply his bonus spells or power points, they cannot be shifted.
