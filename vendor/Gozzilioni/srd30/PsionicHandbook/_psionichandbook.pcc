#Remove the '#' in front of those lines referring to files that you actually want to load
#Remember to set the GAMEMODE to the one you really want.
#Options in the Open Source data are 3e, 35e, Modern, Deadlands, Sidewinder, Spycraft, or Xcrawl.

#If you use this framework to set up a dataset of your own, then you may want to rename the folder and files to something
#different. Otherwise if you ever should install a newer version of PCGen into your existing directory or needed to re-install
#your existing installation of PCGen, your changes would get overwritten and thus be lost.
