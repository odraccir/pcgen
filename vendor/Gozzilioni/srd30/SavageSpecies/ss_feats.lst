#	ASPECT:Benefit|																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Area Attack.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can use your great size and strength to pick up a heavy object and attack an area as a standard action. Such an attack may consist of swinging a large log or smashing a door down on opponents' heads. The area affected is a half-circle with a radius equal to your reach. You deal damage to all creatures two or more size categories smaller than you within the area. The base damage dealt depends on your size category, as given on the table below. Add 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack. Though it can deal significant damage, this form of attack is awkward and unbalancing. You incur a -2 penalty to your Armor Class and on Reflex saves until your next action.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Assume Supernatural Ability.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You learn to use a single supernatural ability of another kind of creature while assuming its form through aPolymorph Spell pell or a similar effect. The saving throw DC against this ability is based on your ability scores, not those of a standard creature of the kind whose form you've assumed. For a breath weapon, the saving throw DC is 10 + your Constitution modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice (rounded down). For all other supernatural abilities, the saving throw (if any) DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice (rounded down). If a creature, such as an undead, has no Constitution score, use its Charisma modifier or its Constitution modifier (+0 for a nonability), whichever is higher, to determine the save DC. Using this alien ability is disorienting. You take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Additionally, in a stressful or demanding situation (such as combat), you must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or be unable to use the ability.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Blowhard.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As an attack action, you can use your breath to affect all creatures in a cone 5 feet in length per point of your Constitution bonus (%1). Each creature in the area is affected as through struck by a wind effect|5*CON																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Bonus Breath.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can breathe one additional time per day. The interval you must wait between breaths is 1 hour. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you can breathe one additional time per day.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Controlled Respiration.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can control your breathing so as to remain out of water for a longer period of time than you otherwise could. Double the normal time limit after which you must begin making Constitution checks to avoid suffocation. This feat does not allow creatures that cannot normally breathe air, such as fish, to do so.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Crush.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As a standard action, you can jump or fall onto opponents, using your whole body to crush them. This attack is useful only against creatures at least three size categories smaller than yourself. The base damage for a crush attack depends on your size category, as given on the table above. Add 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack. A crush attack deals bludgeoning damage and affects as many creatures as can fit under your body (see Large and Small Creatures in Combat in Chapter 8 of the PHB). Each creature in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + your Str modifier + your size modifier for grapple attacks). On a failure, the opponent is pinned and automatically takes crush damage each round the pin is maintained.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Cumbrous Dodge.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You may activate this feat as a free action. You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class for the rest of the current encounter. At the end of the encounter, you are fatigued. For details on fatigue, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DMG.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Cumbrous Fortitude.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Before rolling a Fortitude save, you can decide to activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the result, you are staggered until the end of the encounter. A staggered character can take only a partial action when he or she would normally be able to take a standard action.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Cumbrous Reflexes.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Before rolling a Reflex save, you can decide to activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the result, you are prone and dazed. For details on these conditions, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DMG.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Cumbrous Will.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Before rolling a Will save, you can decide to activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the result, you are shaken until the end of the encounter. A shaken character takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saving throws.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Deadly Poison.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Your poison attack has the potential to deal more potent secondary damage than it otherwise could. If the subject of the attack fails the second saving throw, the poison deals double its normal secondary damage.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Deep Denizen.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Living underground has made you more reliant on nonvisual senses than surface dwellers. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Listen checks and a +4 competence bonus when tracking by scent.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Desert Dweller.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As a desert dweller, you are more hardy than those who live in more gentle climates. Your Fortitude save DC to avoid subdual damage from heat is reduced to 10 Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DMG. In addition, you can go without water for a number of hours equal to 24 + twice your Constitution score (see Starvation and Thirst Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DMG).																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Detach.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As an attack action, you can detach a portion of your body that can make a melee attack other than a bite (such as a paw, tail, or tentacle) and use it as a thrown weapon (range increment 20 feet). The thrown member deals its base damage plus your Strength bonus (not 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus). Special attacks that deal damage, such as poison and acid, take effect normally from the thrown member. Ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain attacks cannot be made with the detached body part.&nl; Special: Tearing off a piece of yourself is traumatic. You take subdual damage equal to one-quarter of your full normal hit point total. Damage reduction cannot reduce the amount of damage taken in this way.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Dust Cloud.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As an attack action, you can sweep a limb across the ground and create a dust cloud. This hemispherical cloud has a radius in feet equal to 20 × your Hit Dice. Creating the cloud has a 50%% chance to snuff unprotected flames (candles, torches, small campfires) of nonmagical origin in the area. The cloud obscures vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for 1 round after emerging. Any creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Str modifier) to cast a spell. The cloud lasts a number of rounds equal to 1 + your Dexterity modifier.&nl; Special: A flying creature with this feat must be within reach of the ground to create the effect, but need not actually be in contact with it.																																											
#Empower Spell Like Ability.MOD																																												
CATEGORY=FEAT|Extend Reach.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Your body or a part of your body with which you can deliver a melee attack is boneless and flexible, allowing you to threaten a larger than normal area with melee attacks. Add +5 feet to your normal reach.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Extra Item Space.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can wear one additional magic item beyond the normal limit for the item type in question. The multiple limbs you have must correspond to the limb on which that item type is normally worn. For example, a character is normally limited to two rings, but a marilith (with six arms) could wear three rings with this feat. Likewise, an ettin (with two heads) could wear two periapts or necklaces instead of the one normally allowed.&nl; Special: You can take this feat more than once. Each time, it adds a new item space. You cannot have more item spaces than you have limbs or body parts of the appropriate kind.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Final Strike.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|When you are killed (that is, when your hit points drop to -10 or lower), your body explodes in a final strike -a blast of elemental destruction- according to the table below. Everything within 60 feet is subject to the effect. Your final strike deals 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die, up to a maximum of 20d6. Each creature in the area may make a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modifier) to halve the damage dealt. The blast also has a secondary effect, which can be reduced or negated (as shown on the table below) by a second successful save of the type indicated (same DC_as the save against the primary damage).&nl; Special: Final Strike renders your corpse unsuitable for raise dead or resurrection spells. Only true resurrection, miracle, or wish can restore life.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Fling Enemy.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can make a grapple check at a -20 penalty against an opponent at least two size categories smaller than you. If you succeed, on your next action you can use an attack action to fling the held opponent. The range increment for the thrown creature is 120 feet. A creature may be thrown horizontally or vertically. If thrown vertically, it takes normal falling damage. If thrown horizontally, it takes damage as if it had fallen half the distance thrown (rounded down). For example, if a hurled orc is thrown horizontally 170 feet, it takes 8d6 points of damage. You may also fling the creature at another creature. To do so, make an attack roll at a -4 penalty, with appropriate range penalties, against the target creature. If you hit, both creatures take the amount of damage that the thrown creature would have taken otherwise, as given above.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Gape of the Serpent.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can swallow a creature of up to your own size category. Like a snake, you can stretch your mouth to an outlandish extent to accommodate immense prey. However, this process is time-consuming. If your second grapple check is successful after you have established a hold against a creature larger than you could swallow normally, you begin to swallow the held creature. On the following round, you must make an additional grapple check to complete the swallowing. The held creature can fight or try to break the grapple as normal while you are attempting to swallow it.&nl; Special: Your gullet can hold one creature of the maximum size; other maximum numbers of swallowed creatures remain the same.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Grass Trekker.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You are a nomad of the steppes, used to traveling long distances, often on foot. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Jump checks. In addition, you do not need to make Fortitude saves when making a forced march until you have traveled for 12 hours (see Movement in Chapter 9 of the PHB). The save DC for longer travel is 10 + 1 per hour beyond 12.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Great Flyby Attack.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Using this feat is a full-round action. When flying, you can move up to your fly speed in a straight line and attack a number of opponents equal to your Dexterity bonus. All targets must be within your reach along the line of your movement. Make one attack roll, add the appropriate modifiers, and compare the result to the AC of each opponent you are attacking. If any hits are successful, make one damage roll and add the appropriate modifiers. Each successful hit does the full damage to that creature; do not divide the result of the damage roll among the targets. Targets of your attack do not get attacks of opportunity against you, but other opponents that would be entitled to attacks of opportunity may take them.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Greater Multigrab.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|When grappling an opponent with only the part of your body that made the attack, you take no penalty on grapple checks to maintain the hold.																																											
#Greater Multiweapon Fighting.MOD																																												
CATEGORY=FEAT|Greater Mighty Roar.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|This feat functions like Mighty Roar, except that each opponent that fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Cha modifier) is panicked for 2d6 rounds. A panicked creature takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks, has a 50%% chance to drop what it is holding, and runs away from you as quickly as it can. The effects of being panicked supersede the effects of being shaken.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Assume Supernatural Ability.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|This feat functions like Assume Supernatural Ability, except that you do not take the -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks when using it.&nl; Special: You can take this feat multiple times, but you cannot apply it more than once to the same special ability. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different special ability.																																											
#Improved Flyby Attack.MOD.MOD																																												
#Improved Multiattack.MOD.MOD																																												
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Multiweapon Fighting.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|In addition to the single extra attack you get each round with each off-hand weapon from Multiweapon Fighting, you get a second extra attack with each such weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.&nl: Special: This feat replaces the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Scent.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can detect approaching enemies and sniff out hidden foes within 60 feet. For strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, double these ranges. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Turn Resistance.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You are less easily affected by clerics or paladins than you normally would be (see Turn and Rebuke Undead in Chapter 8 of the PHB). When resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add 4 to your character level (monster Hit Dice plus class levels) to determine your Hit Dice for turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts. For example, a 4 HD wight with this feat is treated as an 8 HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts, even though it is a 4 HD creature for any other purpose.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Web.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Add +2 to the DC to escape or burst your webs. You may take a full-round action to attack with your webs, and if you do so, you may attack one additional target per point of Dexterity bonus you have. No such target may be more than 10 feet from another target. Using this feat requires two of the daily uses of your web ability.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Inured to Energy.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Your existing resistance to one type of energy increases by 10. You can use this feat only to enhance existing resistances, not to gain resistance to a new type of energy. For example, a demon can increase its resistance to acid, cold, or fire, but it cannot gain sonic resistance with this feat.&nl; Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack. Each time you take the feat, you can either apply it to another type of energy to which you already have resistance, or increase an existing resistance.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Involuntary Rage.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|If you survive 50 points of damage from a single attack and make your Fortitude save (see Massive Damage in Chapter 8 of the PHB), on your next action you gain +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and -2 to Armor Class. These adjustments last until the end of the combat, at which time you become fatigued. For details on being fatigued, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DMG.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Irresistible Gaze.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Add +2 to the DC of all saving throws against your gaze attack.&nl; Special: The benefit of this feat stacks with the benefit provided by the Ability Focus feat.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Mighty Leaping.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You gain a +10 competence bonus on Jump checks. If you intentionally jump down from a height, a successful Jump check (DC 15) lets you take damage as if you had fallen 20 feet less than you actually did.&nl; Special: A creature with this feat is not limited by its height when jumping.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Mighty Roar.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Once per day, you can use this feat as a standard action. Your mighty roar affects every opponent within 30 feet of you that can hear your roar and has a character level lower than yours. An affected opponent must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Cha modifier) to negate the effect. Failure means that opponent becomes shaken for 1d6 rounds. A shaken creature takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saving throws.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Multigrab.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|When grappling an opponent with the part of your body that made the attack, you take only a -10 penalty on grapple checks to maintain the hold.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Multitasking.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|If you have four or more arms, you can use each pair of arms to perform a distinct partial action. All such partial actions occur simultaneously. Thus, you could attack with one or two arms while using a magic item, reloading a crossbow, or casting a spell with two other arms.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Multivoice.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As a full-round action, you can cast one additional spell (or use a spell-like ability in combination with a spell or another spell-like ability) each round. Each spell used in this way must have a casting time of 1 action; a spell-like ability must also take no more than a standard action to use. Using this feat provokes an attack of opportunity. If your concentration is interrupted during this simultaneous casting or spell-like ability use, whether by taking damage or by some other means, a Concentration check is required for each spell or spell-like ability. Failing either Concentration check negates both spells or spelllike abilities. You can also use one head to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while another head activates a head-based special attack, such as a breath weapon or an eye ray.&nl; Special: You still cannot exceed the limit of one quickened spell per round (assuming you also have the Quicken Spell feat) when using this feat.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Narrowed Gaze.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You may choose to limit your gaze attack to an active gaze. Doing so prevents you from accidentally affecting friends with your gaze.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Pain Mastery.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You take damage normally, but every 50 points of damage you take (if you survive the attack) automatically increases your Strength by +2. This bonus lasts until the end of the encounter, after which you are exhausted. See the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DMG for the effects of being exhausted.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Peak Hopper.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Your alpine environment has made you more surefooted. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Balance and Climb checks.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Pervasive Gaze.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|A creature that averts its eyes has only a 25% chance to avoid the need for a saving throw against your gaze attack.&nl; Special: This feat does not affect eye rays, such as those of a beholder.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Piercing Gaze.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Because of the sheer force of your presence, you add 30 feet to the range of your gaze attack.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Poison Immunity.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Your poisonous nature grants you immunity to poison attacks.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Poison Resistance.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Your poisonous nature grants you a greater than normal ability to withstand poison attacks. You gain a +2 competence bonus on your Fortitude saves to resist the effects of poison. If a creature of the same kind as you produces the poison, this bonus is +4 instead, assuming that you are not already immune to the poison of your own kind.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Power Dive.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|When flying, you can dive and land on an opponent to deal additional damage. Using this feat is a standard action, and it can affect only creatures one or more size categories smaller than you. To use this feat, make an overrun attack, but the opponent cannot choose to avoid you. If you knock down the target, you may make an additional slam attack (at the usual +4 attack bonus against prone opponents). The attack deals the base damage given on the table below for your size category plus 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus (rounded down).&nl; Special: If you fail in your overrun attempt and are tripped in turn, you are knocked down, and you deal the slam damage for the attack to yourself.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Prehensile Tail.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can use your tail as an extra "hand." It can grasp melee weapons and use them in combat, although the normal penalties for using an off-hand weapon apply. If you have two hands, your tail counts as a third hand for the purpose of the Multiweapon Fighting feat and all feats that use Multiweapon Fighting as a prerequisite. You can also use your tail as a "hand" to assist in grapple checks and Climb checks. You gain a +2 competence bonus on all such checks.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Quick Change.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|The time it takes for you to change forms is reduced as follows. This feat cannot reduce the time it takes to change forms to less than the time required for a free action.																																											
#Quicken Spell Like Ability.MOD																																												
CATEGORY=FEAT|Rapid Breath.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|The required interval between uses of your breath weapon is reduced by 1 round. For instance, a dragon with this feat can use its breath weapon once every 1d4-1 rounds instead of every 1d4 rounds. If the 1d4-1 result is 0, the dragon can breathe again in the following round (but not twice in the same round). If the interval is a fixed period of time, such as once per hour, the interval is halved.&nl; Special: If you have multiple heads with breath weapons, all your breath weapons use the new interval.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Rending Constriction.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|If you maintain a hold with more than one appendage on an opponent and are able to constrict, you can make an additional rend attack in the same round. This attack automatically deals double the base damage for a constrict attack, and the damage bonus is 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus. However, making this rend attack automatically releases the held creature on its next action. You must reestablish the hold to constrict again.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Reverberation.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Add +2 to the DC of all saving throws against your sonic attack.&nl; Special: If you have more than one form of sonic attack, you can take this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different one of your sonic attacks.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Roll With It.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You gain damage reduction 2/-. This applies in addition to any damage reduction you have from other sources. Damage reduction cannot reduce damage you take to less than 0.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Scramble.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|The effects of this feat resemble those of the rogue's defensive roll, but you can use Scramble to avoid a potentially fatal attack entirely. Once per day, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), you can attempt to scramble out of the way. This requires a Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt). If the save is successful, you avoid the damage entirely. You must be aware of the attack and able to react to it; you cannot use Scramble if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.&nl; Special: Since you cannot normally make a saving throw to avoid the damage from a blow, improved evasion does not apply. That is, you cannot save twice against the same attack.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Stamp.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You may, as a full-round action, strike a solid surface with one of your limbs and create a shock wave that radiates out from your position and continues for a number of feet equal to 5 x your base creature's Hit Dice. Make a single unarmed attack roll. Every creature in the affected area compares its Balance check result to your attack roll result. Those who fail this opposed check are knocked down.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Supernatural Transformation.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|One of your innate spell-like abilities becomes a supernatural ability. It is no longer subject to spell resistance, though it can still be suppressed in an antimagic field. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The number of uses, if limited, does not change. The effective caster level equals your total Hit Dice or the effective caster level of the original ability, whichever is higher.&nl; Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take it, it applies to a new spelllike ability.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Surrogate Spellcasting.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You complete the verbal and somatic components of spells by substituting vocalizations and gestures appropriate to your shape. You must still have suitable appendages and vocal organs. For example, a giant eagle could substitute screeches and waves of its talons for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell. You can use any material component or focus that you can hold. This feat does not permit the use of magic items by a creature whose form could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak if you cannot already.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Swamp Stalker.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You move easily through the sucking bogs and stagnant water of the swamps. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Swim checks and on Strength checks to break free of nets, webs, entangle spells, and similar hindrances. This feat does not grant a bonus on grapple checks.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Thick Skinned.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Your existing damage reduction improves by 2, as indicated on the table below.&nl; Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, it improves your damage reduction by 2, up to a maximum of twice your original damage reduction.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Thunderclap.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You may, as a full-round action, clap two of your limbs together and create a cone of sound that starts at your position and continues out for a number of feet equal to 5 × your Hit Dice. A storm giant using this feat creates a cone 95 feet (5 × 19 Hit Dice) long. Creatures in the cone get a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modifier) to resist the effect. Those who fail their save are deafened for the duration of the encounter. Those who fail their save by 5 or more are also knocked down. See the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DMG for the results of being deafened and knocked down.&nl; Special: This effect automatically extinguishes unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like).																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Treefriend.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You are completely at home in the forest. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost in the forest.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Uncanny Scent.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|You can pinpoint the location of a scent when within 20 feet.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Vicious Wound.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|When using an attack that has a wounding special ability, the wounds you cause bleed for an additional +1 point of damage each round. For instance, a hit from a barbazu's glaive causes the victim to bleed for 3 points of damage each round, not 2.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Virulent Poison.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|Add +2 to the DC for Fortitude saving throws against your poison attack.																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Wingstorm.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As a full-round action, you can hover in place and use your wings to create a blast of air in a cylinder with a radius and maximum height based on your size. The wind strength also depends on your size, as shown on the table below. Because the blast of air only lasts for your turn, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6x5 feet).&nl; Special: You can use this feat for a full round instead of as a full-round action. If you do, the wind lasts until your next turn (and you can choose to continue the effect during your next turn). Anyone in or entering the cylinder is affected. Because you are producing a continuous blast of air, the checked effect works normally while the wind lasts (checked creatures cannot move forward against the force of the wind, or they are blown back 1d6x5 feet if airborne).																																											
CATEGORY=FEAT|Winter's Child.MOD	ASPECT:Benefit|As an arctic dweller, you are more hardy. The DC of your Fortitude save to avoid subdual damage from cold is reduced to 10 (see Cold Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DMG. In addition, you can make a saving throw each minute (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) to resist the effects of hypothermia in very cold water.
