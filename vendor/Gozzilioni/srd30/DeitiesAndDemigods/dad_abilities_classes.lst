Battle Fury	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BerserkClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Bersek can enter battle fury as a standard action. They gain +6 to Strength, +6 to Constitution and +3 morale bonus on Will saves, but suffer a -2 penalty to AC while in battle fury. The increase in Conctitution increase the berserk's hit points by 3 points per level. While in his fury, a berserk cannot use skills or abilities that require patience and concentration, such as moving silently or casting spells (the only class skills he can't use are Animal Empathy and Wilderness Lore). He cannot use ranged weapons. He can use any feat he might have except for Expertise, item creation feats, metamagic feats, and Skill Focus (if it's tied to a skill that requires patience or concentration). While in a fury, berserks attack every being they can see. When a berserk begins attacking a foe, she continues until that foe dies, the berserk dies or becomes incapacitated, or the fury ends.&nl;In order to avoid attacking a friend or innocent bystander, the berserk must make a Will save (DC 15 + the number of rounds already spent in a fury). A fit of battle fury lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. The berserk may not prematurely end the battle fury voluntarily. If there are no longer any beings in sight, the berserk randomly attacks walls, rocks, trees, doors, or anything else she can see. At the end of a fury, the berserk is fatigued (-2 to Strength, -2 to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of that encounter. The berserk can only fly into a fury once per encounter and only a certain number of times per day (determined by level).
