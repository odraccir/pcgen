Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Celebrants of Sharess gain no proficiency with any weapon, armor, or shield.	KEY:Celebrant of Sharess ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency																										SORTKEY:Class_Celebrant_Of_Sharess	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a celebrant of Sharess gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, a celebrant must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a celebrant with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Celebrant of Sharess bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the celebrant's Charisma bonus (if any). When the celebrant gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level celebrant), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Charisma score for that spell level. The celebrant's spell list appears below. A celebrant of Sharess casts spells just as a bard does. Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), a celebrant of Sharess can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level celebrant of Sharess spell the character can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, a celebrant of Sharess could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highest-level celebrant spell she can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell. At 8th and 10th levels, she could trade in a single 1st-level or 2nd-level spell (since she now can cast 4th-level celebrant spells) for a different spell of the same level. A celebrant of Sharess may swap only a single spell at any given level, and she must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for that level.

Fascinate	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:celebrant of Sharess can use her flirtation ability (see below) to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with her. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet of the celebrant and be able to see, hear, and pay attention to her. The celebrant must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other danger prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a celebrant attains beyond 1st, she can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability (two at 4th level, three at 7th level, and four at 10th level). To use this ability, the celebrant makes a Perform check. Her check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the celebrant cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and gazes at the celebrant, taking no other actions, for as long as she continues her performance and concentration (up to a maximum of 1 round per celebrant of Sharess level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat (such as an ally of the celebrant approaching the fascinated creature) requires the celebrant to make a new Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result. Any obvious threat (such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target) automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.	KEY:Celebrant of Sharess ~ Fascinate																										SORTKEY:Class_Celebrant_Of_Sharess	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Feline Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A celebrant of Sharess can obtain a cat as a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours but costs nothing (unlike the summon familiar ability of a sorcerer or wizard). The cat serves as a companion and servant. As the celebrant advances in level, her familiar also increases in power. This cat familiar follows all the rules for a sorcerer's or wizard's familiar, except that the celebrant's effective class level for the purpose of determining familiar benefi ts is twice her celebrant of Sharess level. Thus, a 3rd-level celebrant's familiar can speak with its master, as if the celebrant were a 6thlevel sorcerer or wizard. A celebrant cannot have more than one familiar, and her celebrant levels do not stack with levels of any other class for the purpose of determining her familiar's abilities. If she has levels in another class that can summon a familiar, use either her level in that class or twice her celebrant of Sharess level, whichever is higher, to determine familiar benefi ts.

Flirtation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day per celebrant of Sharess level, the character can combine her Perform skill with her talents at flirtation and seduction to produce magical effects similar to those of the bardic music ability on those around her. Starting a fl irtation effect is a standard action. Some fl irtation effects require concentration, which means the celebrant must use a standard action each round to maintain the effect. Even while using a fl irtation ability that doesn't require concentration, a celebrant cannot cast spells or activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls) or command word (such as wands).

Fury of the Tigress	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Rage	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a celebrant of Sharess can enter a state of rage, gaining phenomenal strength and durability but becoming reckless and less able to defend herself. She temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. This ability functions exactly like a barbarian's rage. A celebrant of Sharess can enter this state once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 6th level, and three times per day at 10th level.

Suggestion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4th-level or higher celebrant of Sharess can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that she has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the celebrant's concentration on the fascinate effect or count against her daily limit on fl irtation effects. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + celebrant of Sharess level + celebrant of Sharess's Cha modifi er) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

Pounce	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a celebrant of Sharess can make a full attack at the end of a charge.

Sanctuary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A celebrant of Sharess who is at least 7th level can prevent creatures from attacking her or her allies in a manner similar to the effect of the sanctuary spell. To use this ability, the celebrant makes a Perform check. Her check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the celebrant or any of her allies, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. Success means the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that use of the fl irtation ability. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly affect the celebrant or her allies for the duration of the effect. Creatures not attempting to attack remain unaffected. This effect does not prevent opponents from using area or effect spells that would harm the celebrant or her allies. If the celebrant attacks another creature, or her allies do so, the sanctuary effect is broken.

Swiftness of the Tiger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When she reaches 8th level, a celebrant of Sharess can function as though affected by a haste spell. This benefit lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to her celebrant of Sharess level. This duration need not be consecutive-the celebrant of Sharess may break it up into increments as small as 1 round if she so desires. Ending the effect is a free action.

Inspire Desire	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CelebrantOfSharessClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 10th level, a celebrant of Sharess can use her flirtation ability to inspire love or desire in a creature she has already fascinated. Using this ability does not break the celebrant's concentration on the fascinate effect, but it does count against her daily limit on flirtation effects. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + celebrant of Sharess level + celebrant o f Sharess's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. The love effect of this ability causes the target to fall in love with a specified creature, which must either be within sight of the target creature at the time the effect is used, or else be specifi ed only as "the next creature you see." The subject takes any opportunity to be near the object of its affection and makes every effort to win that creature's love. The desire effect is similar to the love effect, except that the target seeks any opportunity to become physically intimate with the specified creature, short of causing it physical harm. Inspire desire is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.	KEY:Celebrant of Sharess ~ Inspire Desire																										SORTKEY:Class_Celebrant_Of_Sharess	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HarperParagonClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a new Harper paragon level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the level of Harper paragon to the level of some other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a Harper agent, she must decide to which class she adds each level of Harper paragon for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Harper Knowledge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HarperParagonClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, the Harper paragon can access knowledge in the same manner that a bard can. This ability functions like the bardic knowledge ability, except that the bonus for the check equals the character's Harper paragon level + her Int modifi er. If the Harper paragon has another such lore ability from another source (such as bard, loremaster, or Harper agent levels), her Harper paragon levels stack with levels of all other classes that grant such an ability for the purpose of Harper knowledge checks.

She gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against evil creatures. She also gains a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls against evil creatures. If the Harper paragon has the favored enemy ability from another class (such as ranger) and a particular evil creature also qualifi es as a favored enemy for that class, the bonuses stack.

Celestial Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HarperParagonClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Upon reaching 3rd level, a harper paragon can cast spells as if she were a celestial. Specifi cally, she can learn and cast any spell from Book of Exalted Deeds that has a celestial component, as long as she would otherwise qualify to cast the spell. (That is, the spell must appear on her spell list and be of a spell level that she can cast, and the ability score that controls her spellcasting must be high enough to allow her to cast spells of that level. The Harper paragon can also cast spells that have the specific kind of celestial component that matches her alignment-archon if she is lawful good, guardinal if she is neutral good, or eladrin if she is chaotic good.

Exalted Companion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HarperParagonClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a Harper paragon gains Exalted Companion (see Book of Exalted Deeds) as a bonus feat if she does not already have it. If she does not already have an animal companion, she gains one now, as though she were a druid of a level equal to her Harper paragon level. If she has the ability to summon an animal companion from another class (such as druid or ranger), her Harper paragon levels stack with levels of any classes that grant this benefi t for the purpose of determining the kind of exalted companion she qualifi es for and its abilities.

The Harper paragon gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of its type. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. In addition, the bonus a gainst any one favored enemy of her choice (regardless of the class in which she chose it) increases by 2.

Smite Evil	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HarperParagonClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a Harper paragon of at least 6th level may attempt to smite an evil creature with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to the attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per Harper paragon level. For example, a 6th-level Harper paragon armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+6 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high strength or magical effects that would normally apply. If a Harper paragon accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect but is still used up for that day.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MartyredChampionOfIlmaterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When the character attains an evennumbered martyred champion level, he has a choice of benefi t. He can gain new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class, or he can gain a bonus feat of his choice. He must meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it. If he chooses the spellcasting level, he does not gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level of martyred champion to the level of some other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a martyred champion of Ilmater, he must decide to which class he adds each level of martyred champion for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. A martyred champion of Ilmater is free to choose the bonus feat at one opportunity and the spellcasting level the next time the decision arises, or vice versa.

Unarmed Strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MartyredChampionOfIlmaterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A martyred champion of Ilmater fights as his deity does-unarmed. At 1st level, he gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat if he does not already have it. Like a monk, a martyred champion can attack with either fist interchangeably, or with elbows, knees, or feet. This ability allows him to make unarmed strikes with his hands full and never as an off-hand attack. Usually a martyred champion's unarmed s trikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. A martyred champion's unarmed s trike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and as a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either type (such as the magic fang and magic weapon spells). At 1st level, a martyred champion's unarmed strike deals 1d6 points of damage if he is Medium, 1d4 if he is Small, or 1d8 if he is Large. At 4th level, this damage increases to 1d8 if he is Medium, 1d6 if he is Small, or 1d10 if he is Large. At 8th level, his unarmed damage increases again to 1d10 if he is Medium, 1d8 if he is Small, or 2d8 if he is Large.
