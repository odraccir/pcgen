Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneDevoteeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a new arcane devotee level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level arcane spells before he added the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level of arcane devotee to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level arcane spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that granted access to 4th-level spells before he became an arcane devotee, he must decide to which class he adds each level of arcane devotee for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Reach of the Holy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneDevoteeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, the arcane devotee may apply the effects of the Enlarge Spell feat to any spell he casts. He does not need to prepare it as an enlarged spell in advance, and the use of this ability does not increase the casting time or use a higher-level spell slot. The arcane devotee may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Cha modifier (minimum once per day).

Divine Sinergy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneDevoteeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, the arcane devotee learns to harmonize his magic with that of his deity's worshipers. Any time he is the target of a harmless spell cast by a divine spellcaster of his patron deity, the spell functions as if affected by the Empower Spell feat, if applicable. The spell must be cast by another character- even if the arcane devotee has levels in a divine spellcasting class, he does not gain this benefit for divine spells he casts on himself. A spell that cannot be affected by the Empower Spell feat gains no further benefit from this ability.

Divine Shroud	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneDevoteeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a 5th-level arcane devotee may surround himself with a shroud of glowing divine power that protects him against hostile spells. This ability functions like the spell resistance spell (caster level equals arcane devotee level), except that the divine shroud is of a color appropriate to the arcane devotee's patron. An arcane devotee of Tyr, for example, is surrounded by a steady, rose-purple glow, while an arcane devotee of Cyric is wrapped in a pulsating cloud of purple and black.

This ability otherwise functions like the paladin's lay on hands ability. If the divine champion has the lay on hands ability from another source (such as paladin levels), her daily uses of the ability from that source are not limited by the strictures of this version.

Smite Infidel	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineChampionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a divine champion of at least 3rd level may attempt to smite a creature that has a different patron deity (or no patron deity at all) with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to the attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per divine champion level. For example, a 4th-level divine champion armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+4 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high strength or magical effects that would normally apply. If a divine champion accidentally smites a creature that is not of an opposing alignment or deity, the smite has no effect but is still used up for that day. If the divine champion has a smite ability from another source (such as cleric or paladin levels), she may instead use that ability one extra time per day.

Divine Wrath	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineChampionClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a 5th-level divine champion can channel a portion of her patron deity's power to greatly enhance her own battle prowess. She gains damage reduction 5/- and a +3 bonus on attack rolls, damage, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). These modifiers are sacred bonuses if the divine champion's patron is of good alignment, or profane bonuses if her deity is of evil alignment. If the patron deity is neutral, the divine champion's alignment determines whether the bonuses are sacred or profane. If both the divine champion and her patron are neutral, the character chooses whether the bonuses are sacred or profane when she first gains the ability.

She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the level of divine disciple to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class granted her access to 4th level divine spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class that granted access to 4th-level spells before she became a divine disciple, she must decide to which class she adds each level of divine disciple for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Since it is a spell-like ability, the divine disciple does not need to devote a 4th-level spell slot to its use, though the imbued spells themselves take up her lower-level spell slots, as usual. This ability is usable once per day.	KEY:Divine Disciple ~ Imbue with Spell Ability																										SORTKEY:Class_Divine_Disciple	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF		
Domain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineDiscipleClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, the divine disciple may choose a domain from those that her deity grants access to. If she already has two domains as a cleric, she gains a third in addition to those. Regardless of her original divine spellcasting class, she gains the granted power of the new domain, adding her divine disciple level to her cleric level (if any) to determine level-based effects. If the divine disciple has cleric levels, she also gains a third spell choice with which to fill her domain spell slot at each level. Druids, paladins, and rangers gain no extra spell slots for domain spells, but they can prepare the domain's spells in their normal spell slots.

Transcendence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineDiscipleClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, thank s to h er frequent contact with outsiders and her deity's direct intervention, the divine disciple sheds her mortal form and becomes an outsider with the native subtype. This apotheosis grants her immunity to any spell or effect that does not affect outsiders (for example, charm person cannot affect her) as well as darkvision out to 60 feet, if she does not already have it. Because of her native subtype, however, the divine disciple must still eat, breathe, and sleep, and she can be reincarnated, raised, or resurrected normally. She also gains any alignment subtypes that match alignment components she has in common with her deity. Thus, a chaotic neutral divine disciple of a chaotic evil deity gains the chaotic subtype, and a divine disciple of a neutral deity gains no additional subtypes.

Cooperative Metamagic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.IncantatrixClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, an incantatrix gains the ability to apply any metamagic feat she possesses (except Silent Spell, Still Spell, or Quicken Spell) to a spell being cast by a willing allied spellcaster. The caster need not prepare the spell in metamagic form or in a higher-level spell slot; the incantatrix simply modifi es the spell during the casting. Using this ability is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, just like casting a spell, though the incantatrix can use the Concentration skill with this ability as though she were casting defensively. The incantatrix must ready an action to use cooperative metamagic when her ally begins casting and must be adjacent to the caster. The incantatrix must make a Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3 x modified spell level]) to succeed. "Modified spell level" is the level of the spell slot that the spell would occupy if it were prepared with the metamagic feat applied. Any spell level increases from metamagic feats that the caster applied also count toward the modifi ed spell level. For example, if an incantatrix applies the Maximize Spell feat to an ally's chain lightning spell, the modifi ed spell level is 9th (6th for the spell, +1 for the Maximize Spell feat), and the DC is 18 + (3 * 9) = 45. If she applies the same feat to an ally's silent chain lightning spell, the modifi ed spell level i s 10th and the Spellcraft DC is 48. An incantatrix can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Int modifier.

Metamagic Effect	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.IncantatrixClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, an incantatrix can attempt to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to a persistent spell effect that is already in place. For example, she could use Extend Spell to extend the duration of a wall of force or Maximize Spell to maximize the damage dealt by a cloudkill. To use this ability, the incantatrix must be adjacent to or within the spell effect and make a successful Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3 x modified spell level]. "Modified spell level" is the level of the spell slot that the spell would occupy if it were prepared with the metamagic feat applied). Spell slot increases for metamagic feats that were applied to affect the spell's casting (such as Still Spell, Silent Spell, or Quicken Spell) do not count toward the modified spell level, but adjustments for metamagic that change the spell's effect (such as Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, or Widen Spell) do count. For example, applying the Extend Spell feat to a wall of fire gives it a modified spell level of 5th (4th for the spell +1 for the Extend Spell feat), so the DC would be 18 + (3 x 5) = 33. If the wall of fire had been cast with the Silent Spell feat applied, the DC is still 33, since that feat applies to the spell's casting, not its effect. On the other hand, extending an empowered wall of fire would give it a modified spell level of 7th and a Spellcraft DC of 39.

Metamagic Spell Trigger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.IncantatrixClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, an incantatrix gains the ability to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to the effect of a spell trigger item (generally a wand). To use this ability, she must have the appropriate item creation feat to make the spell trigger item she is using. Using metamagic spell trigger expends a number of additional charges from the item equal to the number of effective spell levels the metamagic feat would add to a spell. For example, an incantatrix can use Quicken Spell to modify a spell cast from a wand by spending 5 charges (1 + 4 additional charges for the spell slot increase). Alternatively, she can apply Empower Spell to the effect by spending 3 charges, or trigger it silently by spending 2 charges. The Still Spell feat confers no benefit when applied to a spell trigger item. An incantatrix cannot use this ability when using a spell trigger item that does not h ave charges, such as a strand of prayer beads.

Seize Concentration	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.IncantatrixClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level, an incantatrix gains the ability to wrest control of a spell that requires concentration (such as implosion, major image, or summon swarm) from another spellcaster within 30 feet. If the target spellcaster is willing, this transfer of concentration occurs automatically. Otherwise, the incantatrix and the target spellcaster make an opposed caster level check. A divine spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check. If the incantatrix wins, she gains control of the spell for as long as she maintains concentration or until the original spell duration expires. The spell functions as though the incantatrix were the caster (even if it is a spell she cannot cast), except that any variables determined when the spell was cast (including its caster level) remain a s determined by the original c aster. The original spellcaster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it. If the incantatrix allows her concentration to lapse before the spell duration expires, the original caster may reassert control over his spell by making a successful caster level check (DC 15 + spell level). If he fails to do so, no one controls the spell.	KEY:Incantatrix ~ Seize Concentration																										SORTKEY:Class_Incantatrix	SOURCEPAGE:PGtF		
Instant Metamagic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.IncantatrixClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a 7th-level or higher incantatrix can apply a single metamagic feat she possesses to a spell without preparing it that way beforehand (if she prepares spells) or increasing its casting time (if she does not prepare spells). Thus, a wizard's prepared spell works as if she had prepared it with the metamagic feat, but it does not use a higher-level spell slot. A sorcerer or bard's spell is cast without adjusting its casting time, but it works as if he had cast it with the metamagic feat. A 9th-level incantatrix can use this power twice per day.

Snatch Spell	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.IncantatrixClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 8th level, an incantatrix can attempt to seize control over a persistent effect created by another spellcaster. The effect must be one that does not depend on concentration but still relies on or responds to the caster's control (such as a summon monster spell or spiritual weapon, but not a wall of fire or acid fog). Furthermore, the effect (but not necessarily the spellcaster) must be within 30 feet of the incantatrix. The target spellcaster and the incantatrix make an opposed caster level check. A divine spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check. If the incantatrix wins, she gains control of the spell until its original duration expires. The spell functions as though the incantatrix had cast it, except that any variables determined when the spell was cast (including its caster level) remain as determined by the caster. The original caster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it. If the spell is dismissible and the incantatrix wishes to dismiss it, she must make a second successful opposed caster level check to do so. If she fails, the spell remains in effect and control reverts to the original caster.	KEY:Incantatrix ~ Snatch Spell																										SORTKEY:Class_Incantatrix	SOURCEPAGE:PGtF		
Improved Metamagic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.IncantatrixClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 10th level, an incantatrix has mastered metamagic to such an extent t hat whenever she uses a metamagic feat, the required increase in spell level (if any) is reduced by one (minimum +1 spell level). For example, a wizard incantatrix could prepare a quickened fireball as a 6th-level spell instead of a 7th-level spell. This benefi t also applies to the incantatrix's other class abilities. Thus, the DC for using her metamagic effect or cooperative metamagic ability is reduced appropriately for the metamagic feats involved, and she spends fewer charges when using metamagic spell trigger.

She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the level of justiciar to the level o f whatever other divine spellcasting class granted her access to 2nd-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class that granted access to 2nd-level spells before she became a justiciar of Tyr, she must decide to which class she adds each level of justiciar for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Passing through any portal that bears a rune counts as "passing" it. To affect a target, a rune must have an unbroken line of effect to it and be within 30 feet of it. A rune that is triggered when passed can be set for almost any special condition the runecaster specifi es. Runes can be set to trigger according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or race (such as drow or aberration).

If the Shaaryan hunter attempts to use the ability a second time in the same day, her mount must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 20) or take 1d6 points of damage. Each additional time she uses the ability in the same day, her mount must make a new Fortitude save at the same DC, and the damage increases by 1d6 points over that for the previous attempt.

The double has the ability scores, base AC, hit points, saves, and attack bonuses of its creator, but no equipment. (Any apparent clothing or equipment is nonfunctional.) Since it can use anything its creator can, the double can attack the creator's enemies if given a weapon or item with which to do so. Alternatively, it can function as the target of a project image spell, duplicating the creator's actions and functioning as the origin of the creator's spells when it is within his direct line of sight. Mentally commanding the double is a free action. Using it as the originator of a spell counts as an action of the sort needed to cast the spell for both the creator and the double. Causing either the creator or the double to leave the plane they share dismisses the double. The double lasts 1 round per caster level.

Selective Spell	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpellguardOfSilverymoonClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Spellguards are specifically trained to minimize collateral damage when casting their combat spells. Once per day per point of Intelligence bonus (minimum once per day), a spellguard of at least 3 rd level may designate a single type (and subtype, if desired) of creature when casting a spell. When a single creature type has multiple subtypes, the spellguard may choose to count only one of the subtypes or all of them, at his discretion. At the spellguard's option, that type of creature is either the only type affected by the spell or the only type unaffected by it. Inorganic material, objects, and anything else that does not have a creature type is affected normally. Casting a selective spell requires a fullround Action. For example, suppose a spellguard is patrolling the forest around Silverymoon with a p arty o f Knights in Silver made up of two humans, an elf, and a dwarf. Suddenly, the group is rushed by goblins. The spellguard uses his selective spell ability to cast a fireball, designating humanoid (goblinoid) as the only creature type affected. The fireball detonates in the midst of the melee, and although the spellguard's companions are within the area of the spell, they are spared any ill effects. At 5th level, the spellguard may designate multiple creature types and subtypes for a s elective spell. Each type or subtype so designated, however, uses up one additional use per day of his selective spell ability.

Cover Identity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ZhentarimSpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Zhentarim spy is rigorously trained to establish nearly fl awless cover identities. For every distinct Craft or Profession skill in which she has at least 2 ranks, she may have one cover identity. Each cover identity must be a specifi c person (such as "Jolan Turnbuckle, bread-baker for the town of Shadowdale"), not a generic description (such as "baker"). She may at any time end an existing cover identity and establish a new one in its place. While operating under any of her cover identities, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks. For each additional 2 ranks (beyond the minimum 2) that the Zhentarim spy possesses in a cover identity's associated Craft or Profession skill, each of these bonuses increases by 1. At the DM's discretion, these bonuses may be reduced or eliminated in regions where the cover identity would seem out of place (bakers from Shadowdale, for example, would attract suspicion in the ruins of Myth Drannor). Establishing a new cover identity or replacing an old one means the Zhentarim spy must acquire documentation and personal effects, establish a place of business, and otherwise set up a believable second life. This process takes 1d4 tendays, during which she may do nothing else, and costs 6d10 gp. The Zhentarim spy does not need to set up a cover identity immediately for every Craft or Profession skill in which she has 2 ranks; she may wait until a good opportunity presents itself if desired. For example, she might wish to hold a cover identity option in reserve to take advantage of the unlikely cover class ability (see below). The cover identity ability does not provide any additional skills that might be necessary to make a cover identity believable, such as knowledge of the proper homeland, the ability to speak a foreign language, spellcasting ability, or the like. Thus, Zhentarim spies generally pick cover identities that complement their existingskills.	KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Cover Identity																										SORTKEY:Class_Zhentarim_Spy	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF

In such a cover identity, she is disguised as someone drastically different from herself-a member of the opposite sex or a different race, or someone with a very different body shape. She may need to spend the time to establish new cover identities if she does not have any appropriate identities available. While she operates in an unlikely cover, her normal bonuses on Disguise, Bluff, and Gather Information checks for a cover identity are doubled (to +8 on Disguise checks, +4 on Bluff and Gather Information checks, and +2 per 2 extra ranks on checks made with the cover identity's Craft or Profession skill).

Greater Charged Item Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpellfireHierophantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A spellfire hierophant can drain a number of charges from a touched charged item (including single-use items such as potions or scrolls) and convert that energy into stored spellfire energy levels. She can drain a number of charges equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1), but she can't drain more charges than the item has remaining. (Each spell on a scroll counts as 1 charge.) A fully drained item has no magical properties- a potion becomes water, and a scroll becomes blank paper. A creature holding or carrying such an item may attempt a Will save (DC 20 + 1/2 spellfi re hierophant level + spellfire hierophant's Cha modifier) to prevent the item from being drained.

Ranged Healing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpellfireHierophantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, the spellfire hierophant can release stored spellfire energy levels to heal at a range of up to 25 feet + 5 feet per two caster levels. Using this ability requires a successful ranged touch attack. The amount of healing is normal for the character (either 2 points per spellfire energy level expended, or 1d4+1 points per spellfire energy level expended if the character has the improved healing class feature of the spellfire channeler).

Haste	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpellfireHierophantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a spellfi re hierophant of 3rd level or higher can expend spellfire energy levels to accelerate her actions, just as if she had cast haste on herself. She must decide how many levels to spend upon activation of the ability. Each spellfire energy level she spends allows her to function as though affected by a haste spell for 1 round, and she sparkles with light while this ability is in effect. The spellfire hierophant can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 9th level	KEY:Spellfire Hierophant ~ Haste	DESC:%1/day.|HasteTime			DEFINE:HasteTime|0					BONUS:VAR|HasteTime|SpellfireHierophantLVL/3																	SORTKEY:Class_Spellfire_Hierophant	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF

Greater Permanent Item Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpellfireHierophantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a spellfire hierophant can drain power from permanent magic items by touch as a standard action. An item that creates a spell effect (such as boots of speed) loses that function for 24 hours, and the spellfire hierophant gains spellfire energy levels equal to the item's caster level. A creature holding or carrying such an item may attempt a Will save (DC 20 + 1/2 spellfire hierophant level + spellfire hierophant's Cha modifier) to prevent the item from being drained. If all of an item's permanent abilities are drained, it is still a magic item for the purpose of making saving throws when damaged, and so on.

Spellfire Reserve	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpellfireHierophantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 7th level, the spellfi re hierophant learns how to store spellfire energy levels in deep reserve. These energy levels don't count as part of her normal storage capacity, but they also can't be used to power spellfire effects without first calling them out of reserve. Spellfire energy levels in reserve don't detect as magical, so a spellfire hierophant's true nature cannot be determined by detecting them. Placing any number of stored spellfire energy levels in reserve requires a full-round action, as does calling any number out of reserve into normal storage capacity. The spellfire hierophant can hold a number of spellfire energy levels to her spellfi re hierophant level plus her Constitution bonus (if any) in reserve.

Spellfire Burst	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpellfireHierophantClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 10th level, the spellfire hierophant can substitute a spellfire burst for a normal spellfire blast. The range remains the same, but instead of requiring a touch attack, the spellfire energy explodes in a 5-foot-radius burst at the target point, dealing appropriate damage to all creatures in the area. Each affected creature may attempt a Reflex save (DC 20 + 1/2 spellfire hierophant level + spellfi re hierophant's Cha modifier) to halve the damage. The character can substitute bursts for as many blasts as she would normally fire in a round, but she can use the ability for only 1 round per day. For every 5 levels gained thereafter, the spellfire hierophant can use this ability for 1 additional round per day (2 rounds at 15th, 3 rounds at 20th, and so on). If the character also has the maelstrom of fire class feature of the spellfire channeler, the area of the burst is a 10-foot radius.
