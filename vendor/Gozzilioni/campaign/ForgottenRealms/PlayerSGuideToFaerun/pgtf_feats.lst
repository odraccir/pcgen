Arcane Preparation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES											PRESPELLCAST:MEMORIZE=N											DESC:Each day, you can use one or more of your spell slots to prepare spells you know. (Usually, you do this in order to apply a metamagic feat to the spell.) Thereafter, you can cast that spell as a standard action even if you apply a metamagic feat to the spell as you cast it. Preparing a spell uses a slot of the appropriate level. Once the spell is prepared, you can't use that spell slot for anything else until you cast the prepared spell.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Delay Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																		DESC:A delayed spell doesn't activate until 1 to 5 rounds after you finish casting it. You determine the delay when you finish casting the spell, and it cannot be changed once set. The spell activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only personal or touch range spells and those with areas can be affected by this feat. Any decisions you would normally make about the spell (including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area) must be made when the spell is cast. Any effects resolved by the subject (including saving throws) are determined when the spell triggers. If conditions change between casting and triggering in such a fashion as to make the spell impossible (for example, if the target you designate leaves the spell's area or moves out of range before it goes off), the spell fails. A delayed s pell m ay b e dispelled norm ally d uring the delay period, and spells such as detect magic can detect it normally in the area or on the target. A delayed spell uses up a slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF	ADDSPELLLEVEL:3				
Innate Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Silent Spell,Still Spell																		DESC:Choose a spell that you know. You can now use this spell three times per day as a spell-like ability. If the innate spell has an XP cost, you pay that cost each time you use the spell. If it has a focus, you must have it to use the spell in this manner. If the innate spell has a costly material component, you need an item worth 50 times that amount to use as a focus for the spell-like ability. Otherwise, you need no components to use the innate spell as a spell-like ability. You must permanently assign one spell slot of the appropriate spell level to the innate spell. You can't use this spell slot for anything else-that is, you can cast one fewer spell per day at that spell level than you could if you didn't have an innate spell. For example, if you could normally cast three 3rd-level spells per day and you choose fi reball as your innate spell, you can now cast only two 3rdlevel spells per day, but you gain three uses per day of fi reball as a spell-like ability	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLLEVEL|SPELLTYPE=Arcane|0|MAXLEVEL|SPELLTYPE=Divine|0|MAXLEVEL[BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=%;LEVEL=(%)|-1]														SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Inscribe Rune	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=3										PRESTAT:1,INT=13					PRETEXT:Appropriate Craft skill.				DESC:You can cast any divine spell you have access to as a rune. You must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce your XP total, you pay that cost upon beginning the rune in addition to the XP cost for making the rune itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when you begin writing the rune, but focuses are not. See Rune Magic in Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting for details on runes and rune magic. A single object of Medium size or smaller can hold only one rune. A larger object can hold one rune per 25 square feet of surface area. Runes cannot be placed on creatures, although they can be drawn on equipment a creature carries. The rune has a price equal to its spell level * caster level * 50 gp. (A 0- level spell counts as 1 /2 level.) You must spend 1/25 of the price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the price to inscribe the rune.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Insidious Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																		DESC:Any Weave user who employs a divination spell (such as detect magic), spell-like ability, or magic item that could detect the magical aura of one of your spells must make a successful level check (DC 11 + your caster level) to succeed. Similarly, a Weave user attempting to reveal the effects of one of your spells via a divination spell (such as see invisibility) must make a caster level check to succeed. The Weave user may check only once for each divination spell used, no matter how many of your spell effects are operating in that area. All creatures employing spells or spell-like abilities are considered Weave users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. This benefit does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Magical Artisan	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=ItemCreation																		DESC:Choose one item creation feat that you possess. When you make an item with that feat, you pay only 75%% of the normal cost to create the item.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|FEAT|TYPE=ItemCreation														SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Pernicious Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																		DESC:You gain a +4 bonus on caster level checks made to defeat a Weave user's spell resistance. All creatures employing spells or spelllike abilities are considered Weave users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. This benefit stacks with those from the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration feats, but it does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Persistent Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extend Spell																		DESC:A persistent spell has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent spell must have a personal range or fixed range (for example, comprehend languages or detect magic). Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effects are discharged. You need not concentrate on spells such as detect magic or detect thoughts to be aware of the mere presence or absence of the thing detected, but you must still concentrate to gain additional information as normal. Concentration on such a spell is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot six levels higher than the spell's actual level.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF	ADDSPELLLEVEL:6				
Portal Master	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wondrous Item																		DESC:When you build a portal, you pay only 50%% of the normal cost to create the device. This benefit does not stack with that provided by the Magical Artisan feat. In addition, you know how to pass through dangerous portals safely. As a standard action, you can attempt to stabilize a malfunctioning portal temporarily. Make a Spellcraft check and add the check result to the d%% roll for the effect of the malfunctioning portal (see Table 2-2 in Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting). The portal remains stable for 1 minute, and you can retry the stabilization as often as you like.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Reactive Counterspell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Counterspell,Improved Initiative																		DESC:Once per round, you can counterspell an opponent's spell even if you have not readied an action to do so. This counterspell action takes the place of your next turn. You can't use this feat when you are fl at-footed.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Shadow Weave Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,WIS=15],[PREDEITY:1,Shar]				DESC:From now on, your spells tap the Shadow Weave instead of the Weave. You can also activate magic items that use the Shadow Weave without taking damage. The saving throw for every spell you cast from the schools of enchantment, illusion, and necromancy increases by +1. You also get a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with spells from these schools. The Shadow Weave proves less than optimal for effects involving energy or matter. Your effective caster level for spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation (except spells with the darkness descriptor) is reduced by one. A 1st-level Shadow Weave user cannot cast spells from these schools at all. You can no longer cast spells with the light descriptor. No matter what school they are from, such spells automatically fail. Your ability to use magic items that produce light effects is also limited-you cannot invoke an item's light power if its activation method is spell completion or spell trigger. From now on, any magic item you create is a Shadow Weave item (see Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting).

Signature Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Mastery																		DESC:Choose one spell that you have mastered with the Spell Mastery feat as your signature spell. You may now convert prepared arcane spells of that spell's level or higher into your signature spell, just as a good cleric can spontaneously cast prepared spells as cure spells. Special: You can gain Signature Spell multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different mastered spell.

Spell Thematics	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=1																			DESC:Due to the unusual appearance of your spells, the DC of any Spellcraft check made to identify a spell you have cast increases by +4. In addition, you may designate one spell you know per spell level as a thematic spell and cast it at +1 caster level. As you gain access to new spell levels, you can designate new thematic spells; you don't need to select this feat again to acquire new thematic spells. Nearly any theme is possible, so long as you can describe a visual link for unification. For example, your theme might be "lightning," "spheres," or " screaming skulls.". If you choose spheres as your theme, your magic missiles might take the form of glowing spheres of light, and your summoned monsters might emerge from mysterious rainbow-colored globes. If your theme is "lightning," your haste spell might manifest as a bright green spark that leaps from ally to ally. You can't use this feat to make your spell manifestations invisible, nor do your spell thematics change the type of damage a spell deals, regardless of its appearance. This feat supersedes the version found in Magic of Faerun.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spell Thematics|1				
Spellcasting Prodigy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,TYPE.Base=1																			DESC:For the purpose of determining bonus spells, treat the ability score that controls your spellcasting (Charisma for bards and sorcerers, Wisdom for divine spellcasters, or Intelligence for wizards) as 2 points higher than its actual value.

Tenacious Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																		DESC:Your spells resist dispelling attempts made by Weave users. All creatures employing spells or spell-like abilities are considered Weave users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. When a Weave user makes a dispel check to dispel one of your spells (including using dispel magic to counterspell a spell you are casting), the DC is 15 + your caster level. This benefit does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation.																	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF					
Twin Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																		DESC:A spell altered by this feat takes effect twice, as if you were simultaneously casting the same spell two times on the same location or against the same target. Any variables in the spell (such as targets, shaping an area, and so on) apply to both of the resulting spells. The target suffers all the effects of both spells individually and receives a saving throw for each. In some cases, such as a twinned charm person, failure of both of the target's saving throws results in redundant effects, although any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel checks to remove the effect. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling. (For example, countering with an untwinned spell doesn't negate just half of the twinned spell.) A twinned spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.							ADDSPELLLEVEL:4										SOURCEPAGE:PgtF

You can bestow a maximum number of temporary  hit points equal to the target's Hit Dice x 3 in this manner. These temporary hit points last up to 1 hour per caster level you possess. A creature that currently has any of these temporary hit points also gains a +2 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves and a +2 sacred bonus on checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped.

For example, you can change the radius of a ring-shaped wall of fire, but you cannot change its point of origin. You can substitute your own caster level for the spell's original caster level if you choose. You can also shape the effect as you desire within the parameters of the spell. As with the metamagic effect ability, you must be adjacent to or within the spell effect and make a Spellcraft check-in this case against a DC equal to 30 + (3 x the spell's level). You can use this ability and your metamagic effect ability a total number of times per day equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier.
