Animal Aspect	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BlackBloodHunterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a black blood hunter gains the ability to take on limited characteristics of his animal form while remaining in his humanoid form.

Wild Empathy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BlackBloodHunterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A black blood hunter of 2nd level or higher can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions like the druid class feature of the same name, except that the character adds his black blood hunter level to his 1d20 roll instead of his druid level. Furthermore, he gains a +8 racial bonus (rather than the normal +4) when using this ability with normal or dire animals of the same kind as his animal form. If the black blood hunter also has the wild empathy ability from another class (such as druid or ranger), levels of that class stack with his black blood hunter levels for the purpose of determining the bonus on the wild empathy check.

Improved Vile Natural Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BlackBloodHunterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a black blood hunter deals an additional 1d4 points of vile damage with each successful natural attack, rather than the 1 point that the Vile Natural Attack feat allows. Vile damage can be healed only by magic cast within the area of a consecrate or hallow spell. When he r eaches 8 th l evel, the vile d amage he d eals w ith a natural attack increases to 1d6 points.

When he reaches 10th level, his damage reduction can be bypassed only by magic silver weapons.

Spell per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MaidenOfPainClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, when a new maiden of pain level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in cleric. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the level of maiden of pain to the level of cleric, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.	KEY:Maiden of Pain ~ Spells per Day																										SORTKEY:Class_Maiden_Of_Pain	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Agony Addiction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MaidenOfPainClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A maiden of pain gains a permanent addiction to the drug agony, also known as liquid pain. However, her addiction to the drug is mild and cannot grow worse. Each day that she goes without a dose of agony, she takes 1d3 points of Dexterity damage. In addition, the negative effects of the drug are blunted by her intimate familiarity with pain. The initial effect of a dose of agony is to stun her for 1d4-1 rounds and force her to take only a single action each round for 1d4 minutes after that.

Extra Domain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MaidenOfPainClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 1st-level maiden of pain gains access to the Pain domain if she does not already have it, or another domain offered by Loviatar if she does. She gains the granted power of this third domain and can choose from its spell list as well as those of her other domains when selecting her domain spells for the day. She can still cast only one domain spell at each level (1st through 9th) per day, but now she has three choices instead of two at each spell level.

Lasher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MaidenOfPainClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A maiden of pain can use a whip to deliver touch attacks. This ability effectively gives her 15-foot reach with a touch spell or with her pain touch ability. If she desires, she can make a normal attack with the whip when delivering a touch effect, but in this case she must make a successful melee attack rather than a touch attack. A maiden of pain can deliver a touch spell through her whip even against creatures that are normally unaffected by whip attacks.	KEY:Maiden of Pain ~ Lasher																										SORTKEY:Class_Maiden_Of_Pain	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Pain Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MaidenOfPainClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a 1st-level maiden of pain can use a melee touch attack to deliver wracking pain to a single opponent. If she succeeds on the touch attack, the opponent must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + maiden of pain level + maiden of pain's Wis modifi er). A creature that fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round, until just before the maiden of pain's next action. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits can't be stunned. The maiden of pain can use this ability twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 7th level, and four times per day at 10th level.

Paralytic Slime	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SlimeLordClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A slime lord's pseudopods are coated with slime that can paralyze a foe. Any creature struck by a slime lord's natural attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + slime lord level + slime lord's Con modifier) or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds.	KEY:Slime Lord ~ Paralytic Slime																										SORTKEY:Class_Slime_Lord	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Pseudopods	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SlimeLordClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The physical form of a slime lord is more mutable than that of a normal creature of his type. As a move action, a slime lord can transform his hands into pseudopods or back into normal hands. He can make two natural attacks with his pseudopods as a full attack action, or one attack as a standard action. Each successful attack deals 1d6 points of damage. The transformation lasts for up to 1 round per slime lord level, though the character can change his pseudopods back into hands before the expiration of the effect as a move action. The slime lord can use this ability once per day at 1st level. Thereafter, he gains one additional use per day for every two slime lord levels. Thus, he can use the ability twice per day at 3rd level, three times per day at 5th level, four times per day at 7th level, and five times per day at 9th level 	KEY:Slime Lord ~ Pseudopods	DESC:%1/day|PseudopodsTimes			DEFINE:PseudopodsTimes|0					BONUS:VAR|PseudopodsTimes|(SlimeLordLVL+1)/2																	SORTKEY:Class_Slime_Lord	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Charming Gaze	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SlimeLordClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A slime lord of at least 3rd level can activate a charming gaze for 1 round. Any creature that meets the slime lord's gaze must make a Will save (DC 10 + slime lord level + slime lord's Cha modifi er) or be affected as if by a charm monster spell (caster level equals slime lord's character level).

No Discernible Anathomy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SlimeLordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 10th-level slime lord's form is so amorphous that he is no longer subject to critical hits or sneak attacks.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.YathrinsheeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Yathrinshees gain no proficiency with any weapon, armor, or shield.	KEY:Yathrinshee ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency																										SORTKEY:Class_Yathrinshee	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Spell per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.YathrinsheeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane and a divine spellcasting class that she belonged to before she added the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective caster level. This essentially means that she adds the level of yathrinshee to the level of some other arcane and divine class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. For example, a 5th-level cleric/3rdlevel wizard who takes three levels in yathrinshee has the same access to spells as a 7th-level cleric and a 5th-level wizard. However, her wizard familiar doesn't gain any new abilities. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a yathrinshee, she must decide to which class she adds each level of yathrinshee for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Rebuke Undead	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.YathrinsheeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The character's yathrinshee levels stack with her cleric levels for the purpose of rebuking or commanding undead. For example, a 5th-level cleric/3rdlevel wizard/2nd-level yathrinshee rebukes undead as a 7th-level cleric.

Necromancer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.YathrinsheeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The yathrinshee has unsurpassed power over death. When she casts spells from the school of necromancy, all her spellcaster levels stack for the purpose of determining her effective caster level. She does not gain higher-level spells any faster than normal or gain any additional spells per day, but the spells she casts are much more effective. For example, a 5th-level cleric/3rd-level wizard/3rd-level yathrinshee has gained two effective level increases in both her cleric class and her wizard class, giving her the spellcasting ability of a 7th-level cleric and a 5th-level wizard. Thus, when she casts any necromancy spell, whether it is arcane or divine, her effective caster level is 12th (cleric 7th + wizard 5th).	KEY:Yathrinshee ~ Necromancer																										SORTKEY:Class_Yathrinshee	SOURCEPAGE:PgtF
Threnody	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.YathrinsheeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a yathrinshee of 2nd level or higher can sing a song of lament that can unnerve opponents who are engaged in combat with an undead creature. In effect, any undead within 3 0 feet of the yathrinshee gains a gaze attack identical to the unnerving gaze of a chain devil. Any creature that meets the yathrinshee's e yes must make a Will save (DC 10 + yathrinshee level + y arthrinshee's Cha modifier) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1d3 rounds because it sees the faces of departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If an undead creature actually is the animated corpse of a friend or companion of the yathrinshee's opponent, the save DC increases by 2 and the penalty is doubled (to -4).

Death Ward	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.YathrinsheeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A yathrinshee of 4th level or higher is immune to death effects and negative energy as though protected b y a death ward spell. An undead yathrinshee instead gains turn resistance +4. This benefit stacks with any existing turn resistance.
