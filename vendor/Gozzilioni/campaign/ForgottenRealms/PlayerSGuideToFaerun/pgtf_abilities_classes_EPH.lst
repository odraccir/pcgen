Power Points per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CognitionThiefClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th level, the character gains new power points per day (and powers discovered, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a psionic class she belonged to before she added the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic feats or item creation feats, hit points beyond those she receives from the prestige class, and so on). She does gain the following benefi ts: an increased effective manifester level, additional power points, and effective additional levels for psicrystal powers (if a psicrystal is owned). This essentially means that she adds the level of cognition thief to the level of some other psionic class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers discovered, and manifester level accordingly. If a character had more than one psionic class that before she became a cognition thief, she must decide to which class she adds each level of cognition thief for the purpose of determining power points per day and powers discovered.

Bonus Powers Known	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CognitionThiefClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the cognition thief learns two new powers chosen from the telepath discipline. She can choose any power from the list that she would be able to manifest. Even cognition thieves who manifest their powers as wilders can choose from the telepath discipline list, which is otherwise forbidden to them. These powers are acquired through personal meditation, just as the new powers learned at each level in a base psionic class are. Thus, they take no time and cost no XP to learn.
