Elfhunter	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRERACE:1,Elf (Drow)				DESC:Any Weave user who employs a divination spell (such as detect magic), spell-like ability, or magic item that could detect the magical aura of one of your spells must make a successful level check (DC 11 + your caster level) to succeed. Similarly, a Weave user attempting to reveal the effects of one of your spells via a divination spell (such as see invisibility) must make a caster level check to succeed. The Weave user may check only once for each divination spell used, no matter how many of your spell effects are operating in that area. All creatures employing spells or spell-like abilities are considered Weave users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. This benefit does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation.

Familiar Spell (Und)	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES	KEY:Familiar Spell ~ Und			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Mastery														PRETEXT:Ability to acquire a new familiar				DESC:You may prepare one spell of any level that you have mastered with the Spell Mastery feat in your familiar's mind instead of your own, treating the extra preparation as if you had one extra spell slot per day, which can be used only for a mastered spell. You can cast this spell normally as long as your familiar is within one square of you. Once cast, the spell is used up, just as if you had held it in your own mind. Your familiar cannot cast this spell itself, even if it is a creature that normally has spellcasting ability.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLS|CLASSLIST=Wizard[KNOWN=YES]														SOURCEPAGE:Und

Highborn Drow	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																	PRECHECKBASE:1,Will=2	PRERACE:1,Elf (Drow)				DESC:You may use detect good, detect magic, and levitate once per day as spell-like abilities, with a caster level equal to your character level.

Improved Levitation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Levitate as a spell-like ability.				DESC:You may use your levitate spell-like ability in 10- minute increments instead of using the entire duration at once. The number of times per day that you may use levitate at the shorter duration is equal to your caster level. If you could levitate more than once per day before taking this feat, multiply your caster level by the number of times per day you could levitate before to get the total number of shorter uses of levitate that you have available per day.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Lolth's Meat	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRERACE:1,Elf (Drow)				DESC:If you kill a living creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher with a melee attack, you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for the rest of the encounter. If you kill such an opponent either by performing a coup de grace or with a touch spell, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for the rest of the encounter. To qualify for this bonus, you must either reduce the target to -10 hp with your blow or kill it with a touch spell (such as slay living).																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Metanode Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Node Spellcasting																		DESC:When casting a spell improved by a metamagic feat, you can deduct the class of the earth node layer in which you currently stand from the increased spell level. (The class of the layer does not equal the class of the node unless you are standing in the innermost portion of it.) For example, if you use Maximize Spell to augment the 3rdlevel spell fireball in the innermost (+1) layer of a Class 1 earth node, you cast the spell as if it were only two levels higher than normal, not three, because the earth node pays one spell level's worth of the metamagic cost. This feat is most useful to casters who do not prepare their spells (such as bards and sorcerers) and to wizards who rarely leave their earth nodes and can therefore prepare and cast their spells at the adjusted level. If you use this feat to reduce the cost of preparing a metamagic spell and then leave the earth node, the spell you prepared becomes unavailable until you return to an earth node layer of at least the same class as the one in which the spell was prepared.

Node Defence	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Node Spellcasting																		DESC:You receive an insight bonus to your Armor Class and saving throws equal to the class of any earth node layer you currently occupy, up to a maximum of +4. For example, if you are inside the middle (+2) layer of a Class 3 earth node, you gain a +2 insight bonus to your AC and saves.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Node Sensitive	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You automatically note the presence of any earth node within 30 feet.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Node Spellcasting	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1																			DESC:You may take full advantage of earth nodes and node magic, as described in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells. This feat grants you access to the various node magic feats and allows you to make a Spellcraft check instead of an Intelligence check to notice nearby nodes and manipulate various node powers.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Node Store	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Node Spellcasting																		DESC:Each time you take this feat, choose two spells of any level that you know and can cast. If you are a spellcaster who prepares spells, you may now prepare those two spells in addition to your normal spell complement as long as you are in an earth node, just as if you had two extra spell slots per day. These extra prepared spells are stored in the earth node instead of in your mind. You can cast them normally while you are within that earth node, even if you have left it and returned since storing them there. If you are a spellcaster who does not prepare spells, choose two spells that you know. You may now cast those two spells while in that earth node as if you had two extra spell slots per day available. Each such slot can be used only to cast its designated spell; it cannot be used for any other spell (including the other spell designated with this feat). If you leave the node, these extra spell slots become unavailable to you, but you can use them again if you return, provided that you haven't already used them since the last time you rested. You do not need to designate a specific node in which to store your spells when you choose this feat, but you can have spells stored in only one earth node at a time. You can change the earth node in which your spells are stored by meditating for 1 hour inside the new node you have selected.

Portal Sensitive	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRERACE:1,Deep Imaskari,Gloaming				DESC:You can detect an active or inactive portal as if it were a normal secret door (Search DC 20). If you merely pass within 5 feet of a portal, you are entitled to a Search check to notice it as if you were actively looking for it. You also gain a +2 bonus on your caster level check when trying to discern portal properties with the analyze portal spell.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Stone Soul	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,TYPE.Base=1															PRERACE:1,Deep Imaskari,Slyth				DESC:You gain a +2 bonus on Search checks made to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. A construction that isn't stone but is disguised to look like stone also counts as unusual stonework. A character with the Stone Soul feat who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as if actively searching.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Strong Mind	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,WIS=11									DESC:You gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against psionic abilities and mind blast attacks. Psionic abilities include the spelllike abilities of monsters such as aboleths, mind flayers, yuan-ti, and any other creatures whose special attacks are described as psionics. Mind blast attacks include the mind flayer's mind blast ability, as  well as any similar supernatural ability (at the DM's discretion)that uses sheer mental force to stun or disable an opponent.

Tunnelfighter	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,DEX=13],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Tunnelrunner]				DESC:You ignore the penalty for hampered melee when fighting in a narrow space (an area smaller than but at least onehalf of your space) or a low space (an area shorter than but at least one-half of your height) with light or one-handed melee weapons. Furthermore, you take only a -4 circumstance penalty when using a two-handed weapon in such conditions. In a space both narrow and low, you function as if only one of those conditions applied (see Chapter 7: Exploring the Underdark for rules on fighting and moving in cramped spaces). In addition, when fighting in cramped quarters, you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Tunnelrunner	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRERACE:1,Deep Imaskari,Slyth				DESC:You ignore the speed reduction for hampered movement when moving in a narrow space (an area smaller than but at least one-half of your space) or a low space (an area shorter than but at least one-half of your height). You also retain your Dexterity bonus to your Armor Class. If the space is both narrow and low, you function as if only one of those conditions applied.																	SOURCEPAGE:Und		
Wisdom Breeds Caution	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,TYPE.Base=1															PRERACE:1,Slyth,Gnome (Svirfneblin)				DESC:At 1st level, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Constitution modifier to determine bonus hit points. At each level thereafter, you use your Constitution modifier normally to determine bonus hit points, but you also gain +1 hit point for every point of permanent Wisdom you gain.
