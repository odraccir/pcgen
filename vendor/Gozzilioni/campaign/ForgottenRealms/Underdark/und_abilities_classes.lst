He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, or the like). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arachnomancer, the player must decide to which class to add each arachnomancer level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level.

At 5th level, he can also take the form of a Tiny or Huge monstrous spider, and at 8th level, he can take the form of a Gargantuan monstrous spider. This ability functions like polymorph, except that the indicated forms are the only ones available and the duration of the change is up to 10 minutes per arachnomancer level.

Unlike the webs produced by the web spell, those in the wall of webs are resistant to fire and as tough as steel. A wall of webs functions like the wall of iron spell (caster level equals arachnomancer level), except that an arachnomancer can use his webwalking ability to move through the wall unhindered, and any other creature can use freedom of movement to do the same.

Bones of the Earth	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavelordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a cavelord reaches 10th level, the earth recognizes him as its own and protects him from death. If the cavelord takes damage that would reduce him to -10 or fewer hit points while in a cave, tunnel, or other Underdark environment, he may attempt a Fortitude save (DC 5 + damage dealt). If the save is successful, the cavelord instantly turns to stone, as if subject to the flesh to stone spell, before death can claim him. (This ability also works if unstaunched bleeding would cause the cavelord's hit points to drop to -10 or below. The DC for the Fortitude save in this case is 6.) His stone form becomes fixed in place as if it were a natural feature of the cavern. Twenty-four hours later, the earth looses its healing grip, and the cavelord becomes flesh again. He awakens with 1 hit point and no prepared spells or power points. Any significant damage done to his stony form (such as breaking off the head, or shattering the body) kills the cavelord.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and the like).

Locate Node	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DeepDivinerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, a deep diviner gains the ability to sense the direction and strength of the nearest earth node, regardless of distance (see Node Magic in Chapter 4). To locate the node, she must meditate for 10 minutes. She can use this ability once per day per deep diviner level, so a 3rd-level deep diviner could make three attempts to locate the nearest node in a single day. The deep diviner's ability to sense earth nodes is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead, and by certain rare ores in the earth of the DM's choice.

This ability can be used once per day, and the sentience lasts for 1 minute per caster level of the deep diviner. During this period, the character can comprehend and communicate with stone and earth, including normally nonanimate rock, worked stone, and dirt. She can pose questions to and receive answers from a pebble, a section of tunnel wall, or a pile of loose earth. A stone normally has no sense of its surroundings, but the deep diviner's presence allows it to recall a very limited amount of information. As with the stone tell spell, speaking stones may relate who or what has touched them and give complete descriptions of what is covered or concealed behind or under them.

If she spends at least 4 hours in an earth node, she can leave with her connection to it intact. At any time during the next ten days while she is outside the keyed earth node, she can activate that connection for 1 minute as a free action. Once connected, the deep diviner can use all abilities granted to her by that earth node as if she were still within it. After using this ability, the deep diviner must return to an earth node and spend at least 4 hours within its confines (see Node Magic in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells) before she can tap its power remotely again.

Code of Mental Abstinence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IllithidBodyTamerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Just as some humanoid cultures believe that celibacy enhances their spiritual powers, illithid body tamers believe that reliance on psionics weakens their hard-won physical abilities. An abstinent illithid body tamer gains 10 temporary hit points, plus 4 temporary hit points per illithid body tamer level. If these hit points are lost to damage, the body tamer recovers them with 8 hours of rest. It also gains a +2 insight bonus on all melee damage rolls for tentacle and weapon attacks. To be considered abstinent, the body tamer must not have used any of its psionic abilities (including mind blast, charm monster, detect thoughts, levitate, plane shift, and suggestion) within the last 24 hours. If it uses any of these abilities, it does not have access to any of its usual benefits for abstinence until 24 hours after its last use of such an ability. An illithid body tamer is not slavishly devoted to its code. If using plane shift or mind blast is clearly in its best interest, then it does so, preferring to lose access to the benefits of abstinence than lose its life.

If its weapon is its primary attack, it strikes with the weapon at its highest base attack bonus (making multiple attacks if its base attack bonus is high enough), but a -2 penalty applies to each tentacle attack made that round. If its tentacles are its primary attack, they strike at its highest base attack bonus, but it can strike only once with its manufactured weapon, and a -2 penalty applies to that attack. A body tamer using both weapon and tentacles can still withdraw the brains of foes with its tentacles as normal, whether or not the tentacles are its primary attack.

Her calculated study of this foe grants her a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks made against that one creature. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against her foe. Each time the Imaskari vengeance taker gains a new level in the prestige class, her bonuses against her target of vengeance increase by +1. To designate a target of vengeance, the Imaskari vengeance taker must spend one full day performing a set of special rites. She must either know the name of her foe or have met the individual at least once. An Imaskari vengeance taker may have only one target of vengeance at a time. She can designate a new target after successfully slaying her previous target or by spending three full days performing the necessary rituals. An Imaskari vengeance taker who has levels in the ranger class may add one-half the bonus noted above (rounded down) to her favored enemy bonus when attacking or using the indicated skills against a target of vengeance that is also one of her favored enemies.

Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ImaskariVengeanceTakerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, an Imaskari vengeance taker learns the art of the sneak attack. If she can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, the vengeance taker's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the vengeance taker flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and it increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 7th level, and 4d6 at 9th level. Should the vengeance taker score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. An Imaskari vengeance taker can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range. With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, an Imaskari vengeance taker can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute a sneak attack. An Imaskari vengeance taker can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible Anatomies- undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The vengeance taker must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A vengeance taker cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If the Imaskari vengeance taker is entitled to sneak attack damage from another source (such as rogue levels), the damage does stack.

Death Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ImaskariVengeanceTakerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an Imaskari vengeance taker studies her target of vengeance for 3 rounds and then successfully deals damage to that individual via a sneak attack with a melee weapon, the target must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + vengeance taker level + vengeance taker's Intelligence modifier) or die. Success means the attack is resolved as a normal sneak attack. While studying the victim, the vengeance taker can undertake other actions so long as her attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the vengeance taker or recognize her as an enemy. Once the vengeance taker has completed her 3 rounds of study, she must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If the death attack is attempted and fails or if the vengeance taker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 more rounds of study are required before she can attempt another death attack. A vengeance taker does not have the option of paralyzing her victim with a death attack. A vengeance taker with levels in the assassin prestige class (see Chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) may add her assassin and vengeance taker class levels together for the purpose of calculating the save DC for her vengeance taker death attack.

Anyone who makes an unsuccessful melee attack against an inquisitor so prepared must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 15 + inquisitor's Con modifier), or the weapon used in the attack sticks to the inquisitor and is yanked out of its wielder's grip. Creatures using natural weapons are automatically grappled if they get stuck. An inquisitor requires one hour and special materials costing 50 gp to coat his body with adhesive, but the secretion remains sticky for up to three days, or until it actually catches something or someone, whichever comes first. Successfully trapping a creature or item uses up the adhesive, so the inquisitor's body can trap no further creatures or items until its coating is replenished. Pulling a stuck weapon or limb from the inquisitor requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. An inquisitor can secrete a natural oil to break up and remove the adhesive any time he likes.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VerminKeeperClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At each vermin keeper level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and the like). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a vermin keeper, the player must decide to which class to add each vermin keeper level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level.

Web Ride	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YathcholWebriderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Yathchol webrider can travel instantaneously between separate sections of webbing.

Moves shorter than 10 feet are possible, but the distance covered in each move is rounded up to the next 10-foot increment for the purpose of determining how much movement potential has been used. The total distance that a Yachthol webrider can move per day with the web ride ability increases with her level, to 160 feet at 4th level, 320 feet at 6th level, 640 feet at 8th level, and 1,280 feet at 10th level.

Web Blast	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YathcholWebriderClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, a Yathchol webrider can produce a blast of hardened webbing (range 60 feet) as a standard action twice per day. The webbing springs from the webrider's hand (or spinnerets, if any) and speeds toward its target. If the webrider succeeds at a ranged touch attack, the web blast deals 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and forces the target to succeed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + webrider level + webrider's Con modifier) or be stuck in place. A stuck creature can attempt to break loose as a full-round action by making either a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check, or it can take purely mental actions. No other actions are possible while the creature is stuck. This ability is usable four times per day at 7th level and six times per day at 10th level.
