Abomination Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Abomination don't eat/sleep/breathe. They have Alien Psychology, Bizarre Physiology, Unknown Philosophy and Unholy Presence.	KEY:Traits Output ~ Abomination																											SOURCEPAGE:DD
																																
Alien Psychology	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Abominations are immune to all mind-influencing effects, fear-based effects, and all spells from the enchantment school. Their minds work in such strange ways, if they even have minds, that mortal spells and magic cannot hope to alter them.	KEY:Abomination ~ Alien Psychology																		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Immunity to Mind-Affecting|Immunity To Fear|Immunity to Enchantment									SOURCEPAGE:DD
Bizarre Physiology	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The forms and bodies that abominations adopt are warped shells spawned by the cosmos to contain the utter blasphemy of their intrusion into the physical world. They tend to take on horrific guises partially because an intelligent mind cannot comprehend their true forms. The cosmos literally spawns a husk of flesh and bone to contain their psychic and physical aspects when they breach the wall into the physical planes. Thus, abominations are immune to critical hits, they cannot be flanked, and they never suffer sneak attack damage. They are immune to disease, poison, stunning and sleep effects, and death effects.	KEY:Abomination ~ Bizarre Physiology																		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Immunity to Disease|Immunity to Poison|Immunity to Stunning|Immunity to Sleep|Immunity To Death Effects									SOURCEPAGE:DD
Unknown Philosophy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An abomination never has an alignment. As a creature from a wholly alien realm, it has no conception of or need for moral and philosophical values as mortal creatures know them. Any spell, effect, or ability that relies on alignment always fails to affect them. If a spell or ability lists an effect that applies if none of its alignment-specific ones work, use that default result.	KEY:Abomination ~ Unknown Philosophy																											SOURCEPAGE:DD
Unholy Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Reality shifts and strains its very fiber to accommodate an abomination's presence. By the same token, a mortal creature's mind can barely comprehend the utter blasphemy of reality that an abomination presents.	KEY:Abomination ~ Unholy Presence																											SOURCEPAGE:DD

Race Traits ~ Crackling Perceptor	CATEGORY:Internal	TYPE:Special	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=CracklingPerceptorRaceTrait|Immunity To Acid|Immunity To Fire											BONUS:VAR|DarkvisionRange|60|TYPE=Base																		
Babbling Madness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CracklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cackling perceptor makes strange, gibbering sounds that resemble a madman's laughter. Any creature that comes within 60 ft. of one of these monsters must make a Will save (DC %1) or act as if under the effects of confusion for 2d10 rounds. This noise results from the perceptor's attempts to communicate with other beings. Their cosmic insight into the nature of reality allows them to alter and manipulate the psyches of other creatures with sound, though there is no apparent reason or order in the actions they compel others to commit. This is a mind-influencing effect.|BabblingMadnessDC	KEY:Crackling Perceptor ~ Babbling Madness				DEFINE:BabblingMadnessDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BabblingMadnessDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|BabblingMadnessDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Babble)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Babbling Madness									SOURCEPAGE:DD
Cosmic Awareness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CracklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The perceptor's supernatural insight into the material world makes it almost impossible to take by surprise. It sees into time, space, emotion, and other dimensions that humans cannot fathom. It counts as taking 20 in all Listen and Spot checks and its sight and hearing extend up to 200 feet in all directions despite any physical barriers that surround it.	KEY:Crackling Perceptor ~ Cosmic Awareness																											SOURCEPAGE:DD
Dimensional Slip	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CracklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Using its strange sight, a perceptor can spot folds in reality that allow it to move to a distant spot with a single step. It can also slide into strange dimensions that interact with the real world but do not cross it. The perceptor can cast dimension door at will. In addition, the perceptor can gain the benefits of invisibility (Greater) at will. While this talent duplicates spell effects, it is not magical in nature. Instead, the perceptor manipulates reality in a manner that other creatures simply cannot perceive or understand. Activating either of this ability's uses counts as a standard action.	KEY:Crackling Perceptor ~ Dimensional Sleep																		SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=HD|Dimension Door|Invisibility (Greater)									SOURCEPAGE:DD
Weakness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CracklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Perceptors are frail enough that they can be defeated through the force of arms. While they are quick and strong, their skinless bodies are vulnerable to attack. Their ability to remain invisible can make them daunting foes, but the small splashes of blood, mucous, and slime that they leave in their wake make them easy to locate and track. Anyone attempting to locate a perceptor gains a +2 bonus to any Spot, Listen, or Survival checks to track or pinpoint one. Perceptors are sensitive to sand, dirt, and other abrasive materials. While they can walk across them with ease, as their feet are coated in slime and blood to protect them, they suffer extreme pain if their exposed organs are ground with such materials. A perceptor coated in dirt, mud, flour, or a similar material becomes partially visible, as the material sticks in its blood and slime, and the creature howls in pain. It gains concealment (30%% miss chance) rather than invisibility, and the great pain it suffers grants it a -2 circumstance penalty to attacks, checks, and saves.
