Portal Sense	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The barbarian's raw instincts provide him with a supernatural sense concerning portals, planar breaches, and other passages between planes. A barbarian who takes the 3rd-level planar substitution level instantly becomes aware of any portal within 30 feet of his location, even if such a portal is normally invisible. In a sense, the barbarian seems to "sniff" out the portal. If the barbarian spends a few rounds "sniffing" around (taking a standard action each round to do so), he learns additional information about the portal (the rounds spent analyzing the portal need not be consecutive): Round 1: Whether the portal is one-way or two-way. Round 2: Any special circumstances governing the portal's use, such as knowing that it can be activated only at specific times of the day (but not what those times are) or if a special key or command word is needed to activate the portal (but not what that key or command word is). Round 3: A brief sense of the area the portal leads to; essentially, the barbarian gains as much information as if he were allowed to see the portal's destination for 10 seconds, without the benefi t of any other sense or analysis.

Trap Sense	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 6th level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

Planar Damage Reduction	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The barbarian toughens his body against injuries perpetrated by unnatural creatures. A barbarian who takes the 7th-level planar substitution level gains the ability to shrug off some additional amount of injury from each blow or attack made by an outsider or extraplanar creature. Subtract 2 points from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack made by an outsider or extraplanar creature. In effect, this benefit grants damage reduction 2/- against the attacks of outsiders or extraplanar creatures. However, the planar damage reduction value stacks with the barbarian's damage reduction against attacks from outsiders or extraplanar creatures.

Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 13th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

Menacing Rage	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The barbarian gains an especially potent fury against unnatural creatures not native to the Material Plane. A barbarian who takes the 11thlevel planar substitution level generates an intangible aura of danger whenever he rages. This aura weakens hostile outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype within 20 feet. Any outsider or extraplanar creature within that area must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 barbarian's class level + barbarian's Con modifier). Those who fail the saving throw take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saves against the barbarian for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting ability. A creature that makes its initial save is not affected by that same barbarian's menacing rage for 24 hours.

Planar Inspiration	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefi t can use his music or poetics to protect his allies from the alignment traits of a plane. The bard must perform for a full minute, spending a standard action to concentrate on his performance each round. At the end of the performance, he makes a Perform check (DC 15 for mild alignment traits, or DC 25 for strong alignment traits). The bard can't take 10 on this check. Success indicates that the bard and each ally within 30 feet who heard the bard perform for the full minute don't take the normal penalty on checks made on planes whose alignments differ from their own (see Alignment Traits, page 149 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting ability.	KEY:Planar Inspiration ~ Planar Inspiration																										SORTKEY:Class_Bard	SOURCEPAGE:PH

Planar Dissonance	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefi t can use music or poetics to infl uence intraplanar and extraplanar portals, moderate or severe planar breaches, and other discrete passages between planes (complete planar breaches cannot be affected). The portal, breach, or other qualifying passage to be affected must be centered within 60 feet. The bard must know about the portal. Each round of the performance, he attempts a DC 20 Perform check. The bard can't take 10 on this check. Success indicates that the bard can redirect the portal destination to the mouth of any other active portal or breach he has personally traveled through in the past 30 days. Redirection automatically fails if the portal chosen as the temporary endpoint is no longer active. Only creatures and objects are affected by redirection, not traits (which leak through planar breaches). Creatures that enter the portal from the bard's side of the portal, or creatures that would otherwise arrive at the bard's location through the portal, instead arrive at the endpoint of another portal chosen by the bard this round. The portal to which the bard redirects travelers continues to connect to its original destination; if a redirected creature attempts to go back through the bard-influenced portal, it doesn't return to the bard's location, but instead to that portal's natural endpoint. The bard may keep up the dissonance for 10 consecutive rounds (this counts as one of the bard's bardic music uses per day).

Suggestion	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A bard of 18th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the Bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect. Making a suggestion doesn't count against a Bard's daily limit on Bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 Bard's level + Bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.

Planar Discordance	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefit can attempt to create a minor planar breach (as the precipitate breach spell in Chapter 5). The bard must perform for 1 full minute, spending a standard action each round to concentrate on the performance. At the end of the performance, the minor breach comes into existence with an onset time of 1d4 rounds, as indicated by the precipitate breach spell description. If the bard has further uses of his bardic music ability for the day, he may attempt to exacerbate the breach further, as described in the spell description.

Planar Dismissal	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.ClericClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:By selecting this planar substitution benefit at 4th level, a cleric trades away some of his power over undead creatures to gain the ability to dismiss a summoned extraplanar creature (such as a fi endish wolf brought by a summon monster II spell) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. To attempt this, the cleric spends a turn/rebuke attempt and makes a level check (1d20 + cleric level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the summoner. If the summoning creature doesn't have a caster level, use its Hit Dice instead. The cleric gets a +2 bonus on this check if the summoned creature's alignment has at least one component opposed to his own (for instance, a lawful good cleric gets a +2 bonus if the creature's alignment includes either the chaotic or evil component, while a lawful neutral cleric gains the bonus only against chaotic summoned creatures.) Success indicates that the summoned creature is returned to its home plane. Each attempt affects only a single creature, chosen by the cleric, that is within 60 feet and visible to the cleric. A cleric can't dismiss a summoned creature whose Hit Dice exceed his caster level + his Cha modifier.

Planar Domain	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.ClericClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 7th-level cleric whose alignment is other than neutral can give up the two domains that he gained as a 1st-level cleric in exchange for a planar domain that matches his alignment (see Table 2-3: Planar Domains). The cleric need not worship a deity listed as one of the typical deities for the domain. A neutral cleric can't select a planar domain. The cleric immediately loses the granted powers of his exchanged domains. Skills that were treated as class skills due to a granted power are treated as cross-class skills for this and all future cleric class levels (though the cleric doesn't lose any skill ranks for skill points already spent from previous levels). He can no longer fill domain spell slots with domain spells from the exchanged domains. In return, the cleric gains a planar domain that matches his alignment, gains its granted power, and from now on may fill his domain spell slots with the spells appropriate to that domain.

The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell of 6th level or higher that is not a domain spell in order to cast banishment.

A planar druid of 13th level or higher can ready a standard action to counter a summon monster spell or any spell-like ability that summons an extraplanar creature. This ability functions exactly as a counterspell using dispel magic, except that the druid need not cast a spell to make the attempt. The druid must make a caster level check against a DC of 11 + the opponent's caster level (if the opponent does not have a caster level for its summoning ability, use its Hit Dice instead).

A weapon that is aligned can overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment. This ability has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment, such as a holy sword. It affects all other weapons wielded by the fighter, but not his unarmed strikes or natural weapons. The ability comes from the fighter, not the weapon, so if he subsequently gives away or loses the weapon, it does not remain aligned.

Unlike with the plane shift spell, the ranger has no chance of deviation from the intended destination. He and anyone he brings with him arrives in the exact spot that his quarry did. Spells that prevent planar travel (such as dimensional lock) affect this ability as they would any casting of plane shift. The ranger does not automatically pick up his quarry's trail when he arrives on the new plane. He must use his Track feat to find the creature's tracks and pick up the hunt.

Fatemakers are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). Because the somatic components required for fatemaker spells are relatively simple, a fatemaker can cast fatemaker spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a fatemaker wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (as most do). A fatemaker still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

To cast a spell, a fatemaker must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a fatemaker with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Fatemaker bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the fatemaker's Cha modifi er. When Table 3-3 indicates that a fatemaker gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level fatemaker), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Charisma score for that spell level. The fatemaker's spell list appears below. A fatemaker casts spells just as a sorcerer does. Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), a fatemaker can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level fatemaker spell the character can cast. A fatemaker can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for that level.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Improved Maneuverability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.AstralDancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, an astral dancer begins developing more control over her "flight" in no-gravity situations. When she makes a double move on a plane with the "no gravity" trait (such as the Astral Plane), an astral dancer's maneuverability drops to good (rather than to average). When she moves four times her speed on the Astral Plane (running, essentially), her maneuverability drops to poor (rather than to clumsy). At 9th level, an astral dancer retains her perfect maneuverability even when she makes a double move, and her maneuverability drops only to average whe she moves at up to four times her speed.

Once per round as a move action, an astral dancer can attempt to switch places with an adjacent creature. The adjacent creature must be the same size as or smaller than the astral dancer, and it can resist the attempt by succeeding on an opposed Intelligence check against the astral dancer. The astral dancer adds her class level to her roll (if the target creature is also an astral dancer, it adds its class level as well); if she wins, she moves into the target's space, and the target moves into her now-vacated space. The movement caused by this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity.	KEY:Astral Dancer ~ Astral Agility																										SORTKEY:Class_Astral_Dancer	SOURCEPAGE:PH

Elemental Weapon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.ElementalWarriorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, an elemental warrior can, as a move action, imbue any melee weapon she wields with the energy of her chosen element. The imbued weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of energy damage on each hit. The effect lasts for 1 minute and may be dismissed as a free action. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her class level. If the weapon already has a magical effect that allows it to deal energy damage, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the elemental weapon effect. When an elemental warrior reaches 5th level, this ability improves. The extra damage remains the same, but on a successful critical hit, the weapon releases a burst of energy that deals even more energy damage of the same type (for a total of 6d6). The additional damage is 4d6 points for weapons with a x2 critical multiplier, 6d6 points for weapons with a x3 critical multiplier, or 8d6 for weapons with a x4 critical multiplier.
