The target creature can be fooled into believing that the charging neraph or the neraph's thrown weapon is in fact not moving closer, or moving closer only very slowly. A neraph can make one camoufl age attack per enemy per encounter (once a foe sees the attack in action, that foe can discern it for what it is for the duration of that combat). Creatures that are subject to a neraph's charge or that are targeted by a weapon thrown by a neraph may not apply their Dexterity bonuses to their Armor Class. All conditions that pertain when a foe cannot apply his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class also pertain to the neraph's attack (for instance, a sneak attack could also be made with this attack, if the neraph can make such an attack).

A spiker can deal extra piercing damage on a successful grapple check, or deal piercing damage with a melee attack, as if she wore armor spikes. Because of their spiked skin, spikers have a difficult time wearing armor. The maximum Dexterity bonus of the armor is reduced by 1, and the armor check penalty is worsened by 2. For instance, a chain shirt worn by a spiker has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +3 (instead of +4) and an armor check penalty of -4 (rather than -2). These changes don't affect the armor's arcane spell failure chance, nor do they apply to shields used by the spiker.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold. On its next action, the astral kraken can either deal bite damage to the held opponent or begin enclosing the opponent in an astral cocoon.

Astral Cocoon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AstralKrakenRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An astral kraken can save a meal for later by encasing it in a translucent magical resin, trapping the victim on the Astral Plane. During each round that an astral kraken holds an opponent it has pinned, it secretes a fast-hardening astral adhesive as a free action. After the fi rst round of cocooning, the opponent can no longer attack, cast spells, or move on the Astral Plane. An astral traveler's soul cannot return to its material body while it is trapped in a cocoon. A creature can escape the cocoon with a Strength check. The initial break DC for the cocoon is 10, and it increases by 10 for each additional round spent cocooning, to a maximum break DC of 30 after three rounds.

Creatures that are stuck on the Material Plane find it difficult but not impossible to target the dharculus. Because the monster is dualplanar and therefore exists partially on the Material Plane while its tentacles are inserted, its foes on the Material Plane can attack the creature as if it had cover, and so it gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class and a +2 bonus on Reflex saves. A dharculus can take a standard action to remove its tentacles from the Material Plane, allowing it to effectively retreat completely into the Ethereal Plane.

After a successful grab, a dharculus can try to attach its remaining tentacles with a single grapple check.

Disjoin	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UnravelerRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A blow from a unraveler against a creature can cause the target to begin to separate into its component elements. A creature must succeed on a DC %1 Fortitude save or immediately take 2d8 points of damage. Unless a creature manages to control the effect (see below), it unravels over the course of 2d4 rounds, until it has decomposed into a few pounds of minerals and a pool of liquid. The save DC is Constitution-based. An affected character feels searing pain coursing along his nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells, manifest psionic powers, or use magic items, and he attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50%% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). Each round the victim spends decomposing, he takes an additional 2d8 points of damage. When 2d4 rounds of decomposition have passed, the victim completely separates into component elements (and is, of course, dead). A victim can try to hold together by attempting a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for unravelers with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success halts the decomposition for 24 hours. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful. Disjoining is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove. A shapechange spell does not cure an affl icted creature but fi xes its form for the duration of the spell. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes the affliction.|DisjoinDC	KEY:Unraveler ~ Disjoin				DEFINE:DisjoinDC|0					BONUS:VAR|DisjoinDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|DisjoinDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Disjoin)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Disjoin									SOURCEPAGE:PH

Training	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ur'EponaRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Although intelligent, an ur'epona requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, an ur'epona must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy or wild empathy check). Training a friendly ur'epona requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding an ur'epona requires a normal saddle. An ur'epona can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he succeeds on a Ride check. An ur'epona can be taught to use its plane shift spell-like ability to travel to a plane of the rider's choice. Treat this as the same as teaching the ur'epona a trick; it requires one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the ooze, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC %1 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (their choice) as the ooze moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the ooze's negative energy damage and energy drain each round, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based.|EngulfDC	KEY:Ooze (Void Ooze) ~ Engulf				DEFINE:EngulfDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EngulfDC|DefaultDCStr	BONUS:VAR|EngulfDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Engulf)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Engulf									SOURCEPAGE:PH	
Shadow Shield	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OozeVoidOozeRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A void ooze is surrounded at all times by a mass of flitting black shadows (the equivalent of a darkness spell, but only covering the void ooze itself). This provides the void ooze with concealment. In addition, the shield is infused with negative energy. Any creature striking the void ooze with a natural weapon or a handheld weapon takes 1d8 points of damage, as does any creature struck by the void ooze. Creatures wielding reach weapons, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage. Creatures with immunity to negative energy effects take no damage from this effect, and undead are healed of damage instead of injured (as by an inflict spell).

Split	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OozeVoidOozeRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a void ooze's energy drain attack would increase its hit points to 200 or more, it instead splits into two void oozes, each with 100 hit points, as a free action. The new ooze appears adjacent to its parent. If no space is available, it cannot spawn on this turn (but will do so as soon as space is available).
