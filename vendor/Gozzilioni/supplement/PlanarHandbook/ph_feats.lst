You can spend a standard action to confound and distract your chosen foe with a constant flood of distracting mock attacks. While doing this leaves you open to attacks (applying a -2 penalty to your Armor Class), your foe may take only a single standard action or move action on his next turn. If you move away (or are otherwise no longer conscious and adjacent to your foe) before your chosen foe's next turn, he may act normally.									TEMPBONUS:PC|COMBAT|AC|-2								SOURCEPAGE:PH

Improved Outer Planar Heritage	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Heritage	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Anarchic Heritage,Axiomatic Heritage,Celestial Heritage,Fiendish Heritage																		DESC:Your unarmed attacks and natural weapons (but not the weapons you wield) are treated as having an alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment depends on the heritage feat you used to qualify for this feat: chaotic (Anarchic Heritage), evil (Fiendish Heritage), good (Celestial Heritage), or lawful (Axiomatic Heritage).

Natural Heavyweight	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Heritage	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:Your carrying capacity is doubled. Double the values given in Table 9-1, page 162 of the Player's Handbook, to determine what your light, medium, and heavy loads are. On a plane with normal gravity, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks, but you also take a -2 penalty on Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks. On a plane with light gravity, these bonuses and penalties are doubled (and replace the normal bonuses and penalties on these skill checks).														BONUS:VAR|LOADSCORE|5			SOURCEPAGE:PH			
Neraph Charge	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=5			PRESTAT:1,WIS=15									DESC:You can charge in such a way as to fool your foe into believing that you are not moving closer, or moving closer too slowly to attack effectively. A victim of your Neraph Charge attack may not apply its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class. All conditions that pertain when a foe cannot apply his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class also pertain to the Neraph Charge attack, if any (for instance, a sneak attack also could be made with this attack if you can make such an attack). Once you have used a Neraph Charge attack against an enemy (regardless of the attack's success), any later attempts to use Neraph Charge against that enemy in the same encounter automatically fail. Once a foe sees the attack in action against himself, the foe can discern it for what it is for the duration of that combat. Special: Neraph Charge has no effect against foes who can't see you.																	SOURCEPAGE:PH			
Neraph Throw	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=5			PRESTAT:1,DEX=15									DESC:You can throw a weapon in such a way as to fool your foe into believing that the thrown weapon is not moving closer, or moving closer too slowly to be an effective attack. A victim of your Neraph Throw attack may not apply its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class. All conditions that pertain when a foe cannot apply his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class also pertain to the Neraph Throw attack, if any (for instance, a sneak attack also could be made with this attack if you can make such an attack). Once you have used a Neraph Throw attack against an enemy (regardless of the attack's success), any later attempts to use Neraph Throw against that enemy in the same encounter automatically fail. Once a foe sees the attack in action against himself, the foe can discern it for what it is for the duration of that combat. Special: Neraph Throw has no effect against foes who can't see you.																	SOURCEPAGE:PH			
Nonverbal Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You can cast spells with verbal components without needing to utter the actual verbal components. You still make noise when casting such a spell (which may be anything from recognizable speech to elaborate song to simple growls), but the noise is unrecognizable as a verbal spell component. (A silence spell still would prevent you from completing the spell, for example.) Spells without verbal components are not affected. This feat is most benefi cial to races incapable of speech in the traditional sense, but still capable of communication. However, it also can prove helpful to characters wishing to disguise the verbal components of their spells.																	SOURCEPAGE:PH			
###TODO: Personal Touchstone CHOOSE:EQUIPMENT|QUALIFIED[TYPE=PlanarTouchstone]																																													
Personal Touchstone	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=8								PRETEXT:A planar touchstone.				DESC:Choose any planar touchstone for which you have previously fulfilled the higher-order recharge condition (see page 154); this is now your personal touch stone. Each time you visit your touchstone from now on, you gain double the number of uses of the higher-order ability when you fulfill the recharge condition. You may continue to visit other touchstone sites and gain the standard number of higher-order uses with each visit to those sites (and you lose the higher-order uses left unused at your personal site, unless you have taken Planar Touchstone enough times to allow you to keep the higher-order uses of more than one planar touch stone Simultaneously). Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a new planar touchstone.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE														SOURCEPAGE:PH			
Planar Familiar	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Familiar						PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=5											DEFINE:PlanarFamiliar|0	DESC:When choosing a familiar, you may add the following creatures to your list of options. You may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away from yours on each of the alignment axes (lawful-chaotic and good-evil).																	SOURCEPAGE:PH			
###TODO: Personal Touchstone CHOOSE:EQUIPMENT|QUALIFIED[TYPE=PlanarTouchstone]																									DESC:																	SOURCEPAGE:PH			
Planar Touchstone	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=8												DESC:Choose any site designated as a planar touchstone for which you also possess an object native to that location, as noted in this feat's prerequisite. When this feat is first taken, forging a link between yourself and a chosen planar touchstone takes 24 hours of uninterrupted concentration. To forge a link, you must spend 10 experience points and expend the object described in this feat's prerequisite. Once the link is forged, you gain the base ability described for that touchstone. If you physically visit the planar location once you've forged a link, you also gain a higherorder ability with a limited number of uses, as described for that planar touchstone. You may repeatedly visit the planar touchstone, each time recharging your usages of the higher-order ability. Usages of a higher-order ability do not stack, so visiting your planar touchstone prior to using up any of your higher-order usages confers no additional Benefit. Once you've established a link with one planar touchstone site by taking this feat, you may also freely visit other planar touchstones. When you do so and fulfi ll the higherorder ability's recharge condition for the alternate site, you immediately gain the base ability of the new planar touchstone site and lose the base ability of the previous site. You also lose any remaining uses of the higher-order ability of your previously selected site (if any), and instead gain the specifi ed number of higher-order ability uses appropriate to the new site. In this way, you can "unplug" from one site and "plug in" to a new planar touchstone site as often as you desire. Thus, after expending the raw materials and experience points for making your fi rst connection, making subsequent connections with different sites is as easy as fulfi lling the higherorder recharge condition. Special: You can take this feat more than once. Each time, you gain the base ability to retain one more planar touchstone location in addition to your previous ability. You also gain the capacity to retain uses of one more planar touchstone's higher-order ability. Thus, you could retain the base abilities for both the Breaching Obelisk and Echolost (planar touchstone locations described in Chapter 7), as well as both sites' higher-order uses, simultaneously. If you then visit a third planar touchstone and fulfi ll its recharge condition, unless you have taken this feat three times, you must choose which of your two previous touchstone site abilities to lose when you gain the abilities of the third touchstone site.

Shadow Heritage	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Heritage	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You gain a +3 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks when in an area of darkness or shadowy illumination.																	SOURCEPAGE:PH			
Stalwart Planar Ally	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																					DEFINE:StalwartPlanarAllyFeat|0	DESC:When you use a spell or spell-like ability to summon a creature native to a plane that has a planar touchstone site to which you have forged a link (see the Planar Touchstone feat), you imbue the creature with exceptional resilience. The creature gains a +4 bonus to its Armor Class and on saving throws for the duration of the summoning Effect. Furthermore, the duration of the summoning effect that brought the creature is doubled. (Effects with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent are not affected.) For example, a cleric who has used his Planar Touchstone feat to forge a link between himself and Empyrea Mere (a touchstone located on the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia) grants these bonuses to any creature he summons from Celestia, such as a hound archon. Special: If a creature's indicated environment doesn't specify a particular home plane, but rather a group of related planes (such as "any good-aligned plane"), you may choose to summon a creature of that kind that is native to your chosen plane and thus apply the feat's effect normally. However, no component of the alignment of the creature to be summoned may be opposed to any alignment traits of your chosen plane for the feat to work. For instance, the cleric in the example above could apply the feat's effect to a summoned celestial black bear (lawful good) or a celestial bison (neutral good), since celestial creatures have an environment of "any good-aligned plane." He couldn't apply it to a summoned celestial lion (chaotic good), since the lion's alignment has at least one component (chaotic) that is opposed to the alignment traits of the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia (lawful).

Water Heritage	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Heritage	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You gain a swim speed of 20 feet, or your existing swim speed increases by 20 feet. Also, you gain a +4 bonus on Constitution checks made to hold your breath. Special: A creature with a swim speed also gains a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks made to perform some special action or avoid a hazard, and can take 10 on a Swim check even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
