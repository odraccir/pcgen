Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WarlockClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Warlocks are profi cient with all simple weapons. They are profi cient with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for warlock invocations are relatively simple, a warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like arcane spellcasters, a warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (all invocations, including eldritch blast, have a somatic component). A multiclass warlock still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from levels in other classes.

Invocations	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WarlockClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will, with the following qualifi cations: A warlock's invocations are spell-like abilities; using an invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. An invocation can be disrupted, just as a spell can be ruined during casting. A warlock is entitled to a Concentration check to successfully use an invocation if he is hit by an attack while invoking, just as a spellcaster would be. A warlock can choose to use an invocation defensively, by making a successful Concentration check, to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity. A warlock's invocations are subject to spell resistance unless an invocation's description specifi cally states otherwise. A warlock's caster level with his invocations is equal to his warlock level. The save DC for an invocation (if it allows a save) is 10 + equivalent spell level + the warlock's Charisma modifi er. Since spell-like abilities are not actually spells, a warlock cannot benefi t from the Spell Focus feat. He can, however, benefi t from the Ability Focus feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual), as well as from feats that emulate metamagic effects for spell-like abilities, such as Quicken Spell-Like Ability and Empower Spell-Like Ability (see pages 303 and 304 of the Monster Manual). The four grades of invocations, in order of their relative power, are least, lesser, greater, and dark. A warlock begins with knowledge of one invocation, which must be of the lowest grade (least). As a warlock gains levels, he learns new invocations, as summarized on Table 1-1 and described below. A list of available invocations can be found following this class description, and a complete description of each invocation can be found in Chapter 4 of this book. At any level when a warlock learns a new invocation, he can also replace an invocation he already knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade. At 6th level, a warlock can replace a least invocation he knows with a different least invocation (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be either least or lesser). At 11th level, a warlock can replace a least or lesser invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, or greater). At 16th level, a warlock can replace a least, lesser, or greater invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, greater, or dark). Finally, unlike other spell-like abilities, invocations are subject to arcane spell failure chance as described under Weapon and Armor Profi ciency above. Warlocks can qualify for some prestige classes usually intended for spellcasters; see Warlocks and Prestige Classes, page 18, for details.

Eldritch Blast	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WarlockClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The fi rst ability a warlock learns is eldritch blast. A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. An eldritch blast is a ray with a range of 60 feet. It is a ranged touch attack that affects a single target, allowing no saving throw. An eldritch blast deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. An eldritch blast is the equivalent of a spell whose level is equal to one-half the warlock's class level (round down), with a minimum spell level of 1st and a maximum of 9th when a warlock reaches 18th level or higher. An eldritch blast is subject to spell resistance, although the Spell Penetration feat and other effects that improve caster level checks to overcome spell resistance also apply to eldritch blast. An eldritch blast deals half damage to objects. Metamagic feats cannot improve a warlock's eldritch blast (because it is a spell-like ability, not a spell). However, the feat Ability Focus (eldritch blast) increases the DC for all saving throws (if any) associated with a warlock's eldritch blast by 2. See page 303 of the Monster Manual.

Imbue Item	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WarlockClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A warlock of 12th level or higher can use his supernatural power to create magic items, even if he does not know the spells required to make an item (although he must know the appropriate item creation feat). He can substitute a Use Magic Device check (DC 15 + spell level for arcane spells or 25 + spell level for divine spells) in place of a required spell he doesn't know or can't cast. If the check succeeds, the warlock can create the item as if he had cast the required spell. If it fails, he cannot complete the item. He does not expend the XP or gp costs for making the item; his progress is simply arrested. He cannot retry this Use Magic Device check for that spell until he gains a new level.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WarmageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A warmage casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards), which are drawn from the warmage spell list given below. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric or wizard must. When a warmage gains access to a new level of spells, he automatically knows all the spells for that level listed on the warmage's spell list. Essentially, his spell list is the same as his spells known list. Warmages also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below). See page 90 for the warmage's spell list. To cast a spell, a warmage must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1stlevel spells, and so forth). The Diffi culty Class for a saving throw against a warmage's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the warmage's Charisma modifi er. Like other spellcasters, a warmage can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1: The Warmage. In addition, he receives bonus spells for a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). Unlike a cleric or a wizard, a warmage need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.

Armored Mage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WarmageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). A warmage's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid arcane spell failure as long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium or heavier armors, nor to heavy shields. Nor does this ability apply to spells gained from a different spellcasting class. At 8th level, a warmage learns to use medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure.

Warmage Edge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WarmageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A warmage is specialized in dealing damage with his spells. Whenever a warmage casts a spell that deals hit point damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to the amount of damage dealt. For instance, if a 1st-level warmage with 17 Intelligence casts magic missile, he deals 1d4+1 points of damage normally, plus an extra 3 points of damage due to his Intelligence bonus. The bonus from the warmage edge special ability applies only to spells that he casts as a warmage, not to those he might have by virtue of levels in another class. A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a fi reball deals the extra damage to all creatures in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level warmage casts magic missile and produces two missiles, only one of them (of the warmage's choice) gains the extra damage, even if both missiles are directed at the same target. If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round. Scrolls scribed by a warmage do not gain any benefi t from warmage edge. Scrolls activated by a warmage also gain no benefi t from warmage edge. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However, staffs activated by a warmage use not only the warmage's caster level but also gain the benefi ts of the warmage edge, if applicable.

Upon achieving alien transcendence, an alienist undergoes a minor physical change, usually growing a small tentacle or other strange feature, such as an extra appendage, organ, eye, or enigmatic lump. An alienist can hide this abnormality in a robe or hood, but the alien growth is not under the alienist's control and sometimes moves, twitches, opens, or otherwise animates of its own accord. This applies a -4 penalty on Disguise checks an alienist makes to conceal her true nature. Anyone who shares an alienist's predilection for study of the Far Realms immediately recognizes her transcendent nature, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma- based skill checks and ability checks when interacting with such beings. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks involving any other creatures to whom she reveals her abnormal nature.

She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard).

She also adds a +1 bonus to each die of damage dealt by spells she casts with the force descriptor. If the force spell doesn't deal damage expressed by dice, she adds only a +1 bonus to the total damage dealt. For example, a magic missile cast by a 9th-level wizard/1stlevel argent savant deals 1d4+2 points of damage per missile. A 9th-level wizard/4th-level argent savant deals 4d6+7 points of force damage with her Mordenkainen's sword spell.

If she casts a force spell that provides an armor bonus or a shield bonus to Armor Class, she increases the spell's normal armor bonus by 2. For example, mage armor normally Adds an armor bonus of +4 to the caster's AC, but an argent savant with this ability who casts mage armor adds an armor bonus of +6 to her AC.

Enduring Force	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArgentSavantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Force spells cast by an argent savant of 3rd level or higher linger longer than normal, and they are more diffi cult to counter or dispel. The duration of a force spell cast by the savant is doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to it. However, the spell's level and casting time are unchanged. The same restrictions that apply to extended spells apply to spells affected by enduring force. In addition, the DC required to counter or dispel the argent savant's force spells increases by 4.

Ablate Force	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArgentSavantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Due to her improved understanding of magical force, an argent savant of 4th level or higher can prevent force damage to herself. She subtracts her class level from damage dealt by any force spell or effect. A force spell producing multiple attacks, such as magic missile, is considered a single attack for this purpose; deduct the savant's level from the total damage dealt by the spell, not the damage dealt by each individual missile.

Unbinding Force	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArgentSavantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, an argent savant learns how to unweave a force spell or effect and liberate its magical energy. As a standard action, she can attempt to dispel a single force spell or effect within 60 feet (even those normally immune to dispel magic, such as wall of force). If she succeeds on a caster level check (DC 11 + opposing caster's level), the force effect is unbound. This immediately dispels the effect and deals 1d6 points of force damage per level of the dispelled spell to all creatures and objects within 10 feet of the unbound spell. For example, if an argent savant unbound another caster's wall of force, the liberated spell energy would deal 5d6 points of force damage to anyone within 10 feet of the wall's former location.

He does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard).

Blood Component	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodMagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A blood magus can substitute a drop of his own blood for a spell's material components, if any, and in so doing increase the spell's power. The pinprick or minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action (just like using material components) that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus but raises the spell's caster level by 1. Damage reduction, if the character has any, doesn't apply to this damage. If a spell has a costly material component (greater than 1 gp), the component must still be provided. If a spell has no material component, a blood magus can still use this ability to enhance a spell if he desires.	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Blood Component																										SORTKEY:Class_Blood_Magus	SOURCEPAGE:CA	
Durable Casting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodMagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A blood magus has a knack for being able to concentrate on casting spells and maintaining them despite taking damage while doing so. For the purpose of making a Concentration check to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when he might be distracted by damage, a blood magus subtracts his level from any hit point damage dealt to him by an attack that strikes him during the action (or whenever he is subject to a source of continuous damage, such as Melf's acid arrow). A blood magus still takes all the damage dealt to him, but the damage is less likely to affect his ability to cast, concentrate on, or direct spells successfully. For example, a 1st-level blood magus can "ignore" 1 point of damage from each source that damages him while casting a spell for the purpose of determining the DC of his Concentration check to cast successfully. If struck for 5 points of damage while casting a spell, he must make a Concentration check to successfully cast, but the DC is only 10 + 4 (damage dealt minus 1) + the spell's level. A 5th-level blood magus could ignore up to 5 points of damage dealt from each source that damages him during casting (and thus wouldn't have to make a Concentration check if struck for 5 points of damage or less). Because of this ability, damage a blood magus takes from using his blood component and bloodseeking spell special abilities never requires him to make a Concentration check to fi nish the spell he is casting.

Scarification	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodMagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a blood magus can inscribe spells on his own skin for later use. This process involves deeply scratching the skin (which deals no damage but often leaves scars). The scratches remain fresh until the inscribed spell is cast, at which time the wound heals normally. Effectively, a blood magus gains the Scribe Scroll feat (see page 99 of the Player's Handbook) using an alternative Medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Scribe Scroll also apply to this ability. Likewise, "reading" a scar follows the same rules as reading a scroll, but only a blood magus can decipher his own scars. One's own skin leaves a limited amount of room to easily inscribe and "read" magical scars. Thus, a blood magus can have only six of these scars at any one time.

Blood Draught	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodMagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a blood magus learns how to store spells of up to 3rd level in his own blood. Effectively, he gains the Brew Potion feat (see page 89 of the Player's Handbook) using an alternative medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Brew Potion also apply to this ability, with the following exceptions. Once "brewed," a blood draught remains in circulation within a magus's body. The maximum number of draughts he can store at one time is equal to his blood magus level + his Con score, but if he is ever slain, they are all immediately ruined-even if he is subsequently returned to life. Blood draughts are never accidentally lost through major blood loss or by a blood-draining attack. To consume a draught, a blood magus pricks his skin, automatically bringing forth the desired effect. This is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, like drinking a potion. Another individual can partake of a blood draught (if he or she has a strong stomach) by drinking 1 ounce of the blood magus's blood as a full-round action. The blood magus must have an open wound to share the effects of a blood draught with another creature; if he lacks one, the creature can inflict a wound that deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus as part of the action to consume the draught. A blood magus cannot store his blood in a container to share at a later time. The blood draught must be drawn fresh from his body, or it loses potency within 1 round.

Homunculus	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodMagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:From 5th level on, a blood magus can use his blood to give life to a new companion creature-a homunculus (see page 154 of the Monster Manual). A blood magus need not meet any of the given prerequisites to create the homunculus; however, a blood magus must permanently sacrifi ce 1 hit point as part of the creation process. The process requires 1 hour. A blood magus enjoys a stronger than normal link with his homunculus. By touching the homunculus, a blood magus can transfer his wounds to the creature (up to 1 hp per level with each touch). This is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Each time a blood magus gains a class level, his homunculus advances 1 Hit Die, as described on page 290 of the Monster Manual, and it gains all the normal benefi ts of its increased Hit Dice (increased base attack bonus, saves, and so on). The homunculus advances to a maximum of 6 Hit Dice when the blood magus reaches 9th level. If his homunculus is destroyed, a blood magus takes 2d10 points of damage, as noted in the Monster Manual. A blood magus's death results in the death of his homunculus. A blood magus can have only one homunculus at any given Time.

Bloodseeking Spell	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodMagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 6th level, a blood magus can imbue his spells with the ability to draw blood from their targets. To use this ability, a blood magus must infl ict a wound on himself; this is a free action that deals 3 points of damage to the blood magus and becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Damage reduction, if a blood magus has any, doesn't apply to this damage. A bloodseeking spell deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to each target that takes damage from the spell. This extra damage applies only to spells that deal hit point damage, not to spells that deal ability damage, ability drain, or other kinds of damage. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect.

If he hits a foe with a melee touch attack, the opponent's blood tries to get free of its confi nement-all at once. The pressure disrupts the victim's tissues, dealing 10d10 points of damage. This ability is usable only once per day, but a blood magus can try to use it again later in the day if his previous attempt failed. The effect is instantaneous.

Bloodwalk	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodMagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 10th level, a blood magus becomes perfectly attuned to the song of blood. He gains the supernatural ability to transport himself great distances via the blood of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can seamlessly enter any living creature (except an elemental, ooze, plant, undead, or other creature without blood or a similar fl uid) whose size equals or exceeds his own and pass any distance to another living creature on the same plane in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. A blood magus merely designates a direction and distance ("a living creature twenty miles due west of here"), and the bloodwalk ability transports him to a destination creature as close as possible to the desired location. He can't specify a named individual as the endpoint unless he has previously obtained a sample of that creature's blood and has it preserved in a vial that he carries. The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar to the blood magus. A blood magus cannot use himself as an entry creature. If an intended entry creature is unwilling, he must make a successful melee touch attack to enter. (A missed touch attack does not use up the ability for that day.) When exiting a creature, a blood magus chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and exiting a creature is painless unless a blood magus wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature fi nds being the endpoint of a magical portal surprising and quite unsettling. If he desires, a blood magus can attempt to make a bloody exit from the destination creature. He bursts forth explosively from the creature's body, dealing 10d6 points of damage unless the creature makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blood magus's class level + blood magus's Con modifi er). When he makes a bloody exit, a blood magus must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round from the shock of his expulsion.

When the savant casts a spell that normally deals energy damage, its energy descriptor changes to the savant's chosen energy type, and it deals damage of that energy type instead of its normal energy type. For example, an elemental savant choosing to specialize in fi re could still cast meld into stone, and its descriptor would not change because it does not deal energy damage.

Spin Fate	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FatespinnerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A mage of many fates understands that "chance" is not as random as many believe it to be, and he can adjust the probability of certain events by applying a force that fatespinners refer to as "spin." Each day, a fatespinner can use a number of points of spin equal to his fatespinner class level. As a free action, a fatespinner can use stored spin to boost the save DC of a spell he casts, adding some or all his spin to the DC, on a point-for-point basis. For instance, a 5th-level wizard/3rd-level fatespinner casting fi reball could choose to boost the DC of the spell by 1, 2, or 3 points. Once he uses up his spin for the day, his ability to tinker with probability in this fashion is also exhausted for the day.

The method is identical to increasing a spell's save DC, but the fatespinner can now add spin to any skill check, attack roll, or saving throw that he attempts on a point-for-point basis.

Once per day as a free action, the fatespinner selects a target creature he can see within 30 feet with Hit Dice equal to or less than his. The creature receives either a -10 penalty or a +10 bonus on its next saving throw, as decided by the fatespinner. If the selected target has more Hit Dice than the fatespinner, the ability doesn't work but the use for the day is not wasted. This effect lasts only for 1 round, so if no spell or other effect is brought to bear on the target creature during the round, the creature's fate is no longer sealed.

When a geometer casts a prepared spell in conjunction with a spellglyph scribed for that spell, he can cast the spell as if it were affected by the Silent Spell feat. The spellglyph replaces any material components (other than a focus) normally required by the spell. A geometer chooses at the time of casting whether to use a spellglyph. An expended spellglyph disappears, just like any other material component. Spellglyphs are normally scribed on parchment, much like scrolls. Preparing a spellglyph requires 1 hour and the use of rare inks costing 25 gp per spell level.

In addition, a character inside a personal or area warding imbued with a yellow veil has immunity to poison introduced from outside the warding (such as from a creature with an envenomed weapon striking through the barrier). A creature crossing a yellow veil takes 80 points of electricity damage (Refl ex half). A disintegrate spell destroys theveil but is negated in the process.

This barrier destroys all objects and effects that cross it, as if they were disintegrated. Living creatures passing a violet veil must succeed on a Will save or be shifted to a random place on a random plane (as the plane shift spell).

She can raise a warding as an immediate action (see page 86), after an opponent begins an action but before it is completed. For example, if she sees an enemy warrior charging her, she can raise a warding to protect herself. The opponent can choose to continue the charge through the warding or can halt outside it.

Double Warding	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.InitiateOfTheSevenfoldVeilClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level and higher, an initiate can raise two veils at once any time she creates a warding. This still counts as only one use of her warding ability. The less powerful effect (progressing from red up through violet) is always considered to be "outside" the more powerful effect, so a double warding consisting of a blue veil and a green veil would subject any creature passing through to the green veil fi rst, followed by the blue veil. To negate the entire warding, the outermost veil must be negated before the inner veil can be negated.

Kaleidoscopi Doom	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.InitiateOfTheSevenfoldVeilClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 7th level, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil learns the secret of the awesome kaleidoscopic doom. Once per day as a standard action, she designates one creature within 60 feet and turns magical effects currently affecting the creature against it. This effect functions like a targeted greater dispel magic, except that for every spell or effect negated on the target, the effect of one veil (see above) is visited on the victim as if the subject had crossed it. The veils created around the victim proceed through the spectrum from red to violet, with one veil activated per spell negated. Thus, a creature with three spells negated would be subject to the effects of the red, orange, and yellow veils. The subject is still entitled to the normal saving throws allowed by each veil.

Guild Member	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MageOfTheArcaneOrderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A "guild-level" mage of the Arcane Order pays monetary dues and accepts various duties in return for member benefi ts. The dues are 30 gp per month. Duties include putting in an appearance on campus at least once every six months and accepting any special commissions handed down by senior members. A guildmage who falls into arrears on his dues by more than three months has his membership revoked and loses access to the Spellpool. Reinstating membership is diffi cult. However, ex-members do not lose any spells or metamagic feats they had gained while in good standing. A member in good standing can board at the Arcane Order campus between adventures, paying only 5 sp per day for common-quality meals and lodging. At his leisure, he can browse the Order's well-respected library, which is stocked with tomes on both mundane and arcane lore (though no spellbooks are kept here). Likewise, he can use the Order's common laboratory facilities when creating magic items (although material costs remain out-of-pocket). Furthermore, he is free to read and post notices to the "job board," a mundane medium whereby fellow members of the Order pass information, advertise their interest in a research topic or adventure, or attempt to sell an interesting oddity, magical or otherwise. Last but not least, members form professional ties with their fellow wizards, possibly leading to lasting friendships or alliances.

Regent	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MageOfTheArcaneOrderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 10th-level mage of the Arcane Order is awarded the status of regent. A regent gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma-based interaction checks when dealing with lower-level members of the Order. The regents set the Arcane Order's rules and policies, meeting each month in the Council of Regents. A regent must attend six council meetings in one year or be removed from the council and lose his regent status (he loses no other benefi ts of guild membership, nor does he lose his level in the prestige class). Enacting new policies or eradicating old ones requires a three-fi fths majority vote to pass. Generally, the council hands out commissions for lowerlevel mages of the Arcane Order to perform on behalf of the guild. An individual regent might also head up a special group of lower-level members to accomplish a specifi c goal, such as investigating a crime committed using magic, undertaking an archeological dig of an ancient site of wizardry, or some other important task.

Favored Shape	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterTransmogrifClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A master transmogrifi st chooses three favored shapes at 1st level. A favored shape is a specifi c kind of creature whose form he can assume by means of the polymorph spell. He cannot choose a creature of his own type (humanoid, most likely) as a favored shape. For example, an 8th-level human sorcerer/1st-level master transmogrifi st might choose pegasus, umber hulk, and bronze dragon as his favored shapes, though because of the Hit Dice restriction, he could become only a very young bronze dragon. A master transmogrifi st gains a number of advantages with his favored shapes, as noted in the following class feature descriptions. At every odd-numbered level beyond 1st, a master transmogrifi st gains one additional favored shape. Thus, he has four at 3rd level, fi ve at 5th level, six at 7th level, and seven at 9th level.

Reflective Change	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterTransmogrifClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 7th level and higher, a master transmogrifi st has the ability to change into a favored shape via a transmutation spell in response to an opponent's action once per day. If he has an appropriate spell prepared and chooses to use this ability, he can change form as an immediate action (see page 86) in response to the action of another creature. For example, a master transmogrifi st might turn into a dragon turtle to gain a high Armor Class against an impending attack, or change into a red dragon to gain immunity to the fi re damage of an enemy's fi re storm spell. The spell is expended as if the transmogrifi st had cast it normally, and he remains in his new form until either the spell's duration expires or he dismisses it. A transmogrifi st gives up his next action to make a refl exive change. If a master transmogrifi st is currently under the effect of a shapechange spell he cast on himself, he can use his refl exive change ability as often as he likes (although never more than once per round).

To create an imaginary form, he chooses one of his favored shapes as a base form. He can then choose a single aspect of a second monster whose form he could assume using the spell he is casting and add it to the fi rst creature. His available options include the following.&nl;- Replace the base form's natural armor bonus with that of the second form.&nl;- Add the second form's movement modes.&nl;- Add one of the second form's natural attack types (with the appropriate reach), if the base form doesn't have that attack type already.&nl;- Add an extraordinary special attack of the second form.&nl;- Add an extraordinary special quality of the second form.&nl;- Replace one of the base form's physical ability scores, if both the base form and the second form are the same size category. &nl;For example, if a young red dragon is the base form and a giant octopus is the second, a master transmogrifi st could add the octopus's eight tentacle rakes (damage 1d4 + Str bonus) to the dragon's available natural attacks.

Seeker Music	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SeekerOfTheSongClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A seeker of the song can use music or poetics to produce magical effects. Seeker music follows the same rules as bardic music (see page 29 of the Players Handbook). Each use of seeker music costs one daily use of bardic music to activate. Seeker of the song levels stack with bard levels for purposes of determining how many daily uses of bardic music and seeker music the character has. Some seeker music effects include a secondary effect, called a refrain. In any round when a seeker concentrates on a seeker music effect and expends another use of bardic music, she can activate the refrain associated with that seeker music effect. Using a refrain is a swift action (see page 86) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The original effects of the song do not end; the seeker can maintain the song and activate the refrain simultaneously.
