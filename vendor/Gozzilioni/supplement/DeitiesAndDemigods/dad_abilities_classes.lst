Battle Fury	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BerserkerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 1st level, berserks can enter battle fury as a standard action. They gain +6 to Strength, +6 to Constitution, and a +3 morale bonus on Will saves, but suffer a -2 penalty to AC while in battle fury. The increase in Constitution increases the berserk's hit points by 3 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the fury when the Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are; see Temporary Hit Points in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook.) While in his fury, a berserk cannot use skills or abilities that require patience and concentration, such as moving silently or casting spells (the only class skills he can't use are Animal Empathy and Wilderness Lore). He cannot use ranged weapons. He can use any feat he might have except for Expertise, item creation feats, metamagic feats, and Skill Focus (if it's tied to a skill that requires patience or concentration). While in a fury, berserks attack every being they can see. When a berserk begins attacking a foe, she continues until that foe dies, the berserk dies or becomes incapacitated, or the fury ends. In order to avoid attacking a friend or innocent bystander, the berserk must make a Will save (DC 15 + the number of rounds already spent in a fury). A fit of battle fury lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. The berserk may not prematurely end the battle fury voluntarily. If there are no longer any beings in sight, the berserk randomly attacks walls, rocks, trees, doors, or anything else she can see. At the end of a fury, the berserk is fatigued (-2 to Strength, -2 to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of that encounter. The berserk can only fly into a fury once per encounter and only a certain number of times per day (determined by level).

Movement Bonus	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BerserkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, berserks increase their movement rate by 10 feet.

Beast Shape	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BerserkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, the berserk selects a totem animal from the following list: bear (brown), boar, eagle, raven, whale (cachalot), or wolf. A number of times per day determined by level, the berserk may change shape into a hybrid creature with features that combine human and animal, or into the animal itself. A hybrid retains the use of human arms, hands, and intelligence, but loses the power of speech. A hybrid cannot use skills or abilities that require patience and concentration, such as moving silently or casting spells (the only class skills he can't use are Animal Empathy and Wilderness Lore). He can use any feat he might have except for Expertise, item creation feats, metamagic feats, and Skill Focus (if it's tied to a skill that requires patience or concentration). Hybrids also gain +2 Strength and +2 Constitution. The increase in Constitution increases the berserk's hit points by 1 point per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the fury when the Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are; see Temporary Hit Points in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook.) While in animal form, the berserk gains the abilities and movement speeds of the animal and retains her human intelligence. A berserk cannot use battle fury while in either hybrid or animal form, nor can she use beast shape while in battle fury. A berserk can always change back to human form. No equipment or clothing transforms with the berserk.

Damage Reduction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BerserkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, the berserk gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 1 from the damage the berserk takes each time she is dealt damage. At 4th level, this damage reduction rises to 2. At 6th level it rises to 3. At 8th level it rises to 4.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.JusticiarOfTaiiaClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At1st level, a justiciar of Taiia gains any one weapon proficiency feat (Simple Weapon Proficiency, Martial Weapon Proficiency with a certain weapon, or Exotic Weapon Proficiency with a certain weapon) as a bonus feat. Otherwise, justiciars do not gain any additional weapon or armor proficiency.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.JusticiarOfTaiiaClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a justiciar of Taiia gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the justiciar must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + spell level, so a justiciar with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Justiciar bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the justiciar's Wisdom modifier (if any). When the justiciar gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, the justiciar gets only bonus spells. A justiciar without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. The justiciar's spell list appears below. A justiciar prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though the justiciar cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells).

Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.JusticiarOfTaiiaClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a justiciar of Taiia can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the justiciar's target would be denied her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the justiciar flanks the target, the justiciar's attack deals extra damage. The extra damage is +1d6 at 1st level and an additional 1d6 every three levels thereafter. Should the justiciar score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is within 30 feet. A justiciar of Taiia cannot make a sneak attack to deal subdual damage. The justiciar must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The justiciar cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. A justiciar of Taiia can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. If a justiciar gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack.

Energon Companion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoldierOfLightClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a soldier of the light can summon a xag-ya, an outsider formed of positive energy. This xag-ya serves as a companion to the soldier and can communicate telepathically with him when it is within range and line of sight (though its thoughts are sometimes alien and cryptic).

If an energon companion is killed, or the soldier of light chooses to dismiss it, the soldier of light must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15). If the saving throw fails, the soldier of light loses 200 experience points per soldier level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss by half, to 100 XP per class level.
