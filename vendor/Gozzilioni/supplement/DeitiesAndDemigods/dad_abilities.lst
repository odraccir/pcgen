# Salient divine abilities																																
Alter Form	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including clothing and equipment. The assumed form must be corporeal. The deity's body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can fly. Likewise, the deity can swim if the form has fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on. The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.																			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Salient Divine Ability,Alter Size									SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Alter Reality	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability is similar to the wish spell. The deity merely thinks of something and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.																												SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Alter Size	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability	TYPE:Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a free action, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. The deity also can change the size of up to 100 pounds of objects it touches. If the deity has a familiar, personal mount, or personal intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight counts against the deity's weight limit. This is a supernatural ability.																												SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Annihilating Strike	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When the deity strikes with a weapon or natural weapon, the opponent struck might be obliterated. Creatures, attended objects, and magic items must make Fortitude saves (DC 20 + the deity's rank + the damage dealt) or be reduced to -10 hit points and killed outright. Unattended, nonmagical objects are obliterated. The deity can destroy up to 1,000 cubic feet (a 10-foot cube) of nonliving matter per rank, so the ability destroys only part of any very large object or structure targeted.																			PREVARGTEQ:DivineRank,11	PRETOTALAB:20	PRESTAT:1,STR=25							SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Arcane Mastery	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The deity can prepare any wizard spell that it can cast without using a spellbook.																			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1	PRESTAT:1,INT=29	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Mastery							SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Area Divine Shield	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Except where noted here, this ability works like the Divine Shield ability. The deity produces a transparent barrier whose area is up to one 10-foot square per rank, or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per rank. The barrier can be placed anywhere within the deity's line of sight. The deity can place the barrier so that it is mobile with respect to some unattended object or willing creature (such as the deity itself ).																			PREVARGTEQ:DivineRank,6	PRESTAT:1,CHA=29	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Salient Divine Ability,Divine Shield							SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Automatic Metamagic	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The deity chooses one metamagic feat. As a free action, the deity can apply the selected feat to the spells from any one spellcasting class the deity has or to its spell-like abilities. A spell altered by the use of this ability does not use up a higher-level slot.															STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:FEAT|TYPE=Metamagic		PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1									SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Avatar	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An avatar serves as a deity's alter ego, effectively allowing the deity to be in two or more places at the same time. An avatar is an extension of a deity. The deity senses and knows everything the avatar senses and knows and vice versa. Each avatar counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and communicating. A lesser deity can have up to five avatars at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and a greater deity can have up to twenty avatars at once.																			PREVARGTEQ:DivineRank,6	PRESTAT:1,CHA=29								SOURCEPAGE:DaD
Banestrike	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The affected weapon gains a bonus of +4 on attack rolls, and it deals an extra +4d6 points of damage against the designated foe. The bonus and extra damage stack with any other properties the weapon has.

Battlesense	CATEGORY:Salient Divine Ability		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The deity cannot be surprised or flanked except by a deity of higher rank. The deity retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even if caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent, and is not subject to sneak attacks except by deities of higher rank.																												SOURCEPAGE:DaD
