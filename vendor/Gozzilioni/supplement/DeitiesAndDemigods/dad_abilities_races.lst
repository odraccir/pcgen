Alternate Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MinionOfSetRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A minion of Set has one alternate form, that of a Large or Huge animal. The transformation resembles the shapechange spell in that the minion gains the extraordinary abilities of the animal form, but changing form is a move-equivalent action (not a free action as for shapechange). In animal form, a minion of Set gains the physical abilities, speed, size and reach, and extraordinary abilities of the animal. Its natural armor remains the same in both forms. Statistics for minions in animal forms are summarized below. For more information, see the appropriate creature entry in the Monster Manual (using the dire wolf to represent the dire hyena).
