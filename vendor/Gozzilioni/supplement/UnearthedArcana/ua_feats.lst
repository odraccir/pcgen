Urban Tracking	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Thug	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:To fi nd the trail of an individual or to follow it for 1 hour requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour of the search, as well as each time the trail becomes diffi cult to follow, such as when it moves to a different area of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on the community size and the conditions: If you fail a Gather Information check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning. The DM should roll the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn't know exactly how long the task will require.

Accurate Jaunt	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to greater teleport, plane shift, teleport, or shadow walk spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:When you use teleport, you can roll the targeting roll twice, taking whichever result you prefer. When you use plane shift or shadow walk, you likewise make the roll to determine your destination twice, choosing the better (usually lower) result.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Bladeproof Skin	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to stoneskin or iron body spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:You gain damage reduction 3/bludgeoning. Your skin imposes an armor check penalty of -2 (which stacks with the armor check penalty from armor and shield).				BONUS:MISC|ACCHECK|2													SOURCEPAGE:UA	DR:3/Bludgeoning
Breadth of Knowledge	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to legend lore or vision spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:All Knowledge checks you make are treated as trained checks, even if you don't have any ranks in the specifi c skill. If you have at least one rank in the specific Knowledge skill in question, you gain a +1 bonus on the check.													BONUS:SKILL|TYPE.Knowledge|1				SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Conductivity	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:to call lightning, lightning bolt, or chain lightning spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:Whenever you take damage from an electricity effect, you may send a line of electricity arcing from your body at any single target within 30 feet. This bolt deals half the damage you just took; a Reflex save (DC 16 + your Cha modifier) halves this damage.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Controlled Immolation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to fi reball or delayed blast fi reball spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:If you catch on fire (as described on page 303 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), you take no damage from the fl ames. A creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of fi re damage. The fi re persists on your body for 1d4 rounds. This feat doesn't protect you from other sources of fi re dam age, whether magical or not, only from the effects of catching on fi re. It also doesn't protect your equipment from the effects of fi re.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Eyes to the Sky	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to scrying or greater scrying spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:You automatically spot the magical sensor created by a spell of the scrying subtype (arcane eye, clairaudience/clairvoyance, greater scrying, or scrying) if it's within 40 feet of you.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
False Pretenses	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to charm or dominate spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:When you succeed on a save against a charm or compulsion effect, the character trying to charm or compel you believes that you failed your save. You can play along voluntarily if you wish to. If the charm or compulsion involves telepathic commands, you continue to receive them, although you aren't obligated to follow them.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Ineluctable Echo	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to wail of the banshee or any power word spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:When you are targeted by a power word spell, whoever speaks the power word is also affected by it (as if he had cast it on himself). Likewise, when you're within the area of a wail of the banshee spell, the caster of the spell also hears the wail and must succeed on a Fortitude save (using his own save DC) or die. Possessing the Ineluctable Echo feat doesn't protect you against power word or wail of the banshee spells. You experience their effects normally.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Life Leech	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to death touch domain granted power or death knell spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:Each dying or stable creature within 30 feet of you (that is, any creature with -1 to -9 hit points) loses an additional 1 hit point at the beginning of your turn. You gain the same amount as temporary hit points that last for 10 minutes. You can't suppress this effect, which functions on both friend and foe.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Live My Nightmare	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to phantasmal killer spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:Whenever someone successfully targets you with a divination spell or effect, you can send that caster a nightmarish vision. This vision functions as a phantasmal killer spell, except that the form comes from your dreams, not the other creature's dreams. The other creature must succeed on a Will save (DC 14 + your Cha modifier) to disbelieve the nightmare and a Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Cha modifier) to avoid dying from fear.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Momentary Alteration	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to alter self spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:Choose one specifi c form that you've turned yourself into with the alter self spell. Once per day, you can use alter self as a spell-like ability to turn yourself into this form for 1 minute. Special: You can gain Momentary Alteration multiple times. Each time you take the feat, you can either extend the duration of an already chosen alternate form by 1 minute or choose another specifi c form from among those you've experienced after casting alter self on yourself.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE														SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Naturalized Denizen	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to dimensional anchor spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:You are never treated as an extraplanar creature (and you lose the extraplanar subtype). Thus, you can't be affected by a banishment or dismissal spell or similar effects that send extraplanar creatures back to their home planes.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Omniscient Whispers	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to commune or contact other plane spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:Once per week, you can tune into the voices you hear, getting the answer to a question much as if you had asked it with a commune spell.

PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:Whenever you're outside during the day, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor (characters who don't have natural armor ordinarily have a natural armor bonus of +0)																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Polar Chill	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to cone of cold or ice storm spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:Once per day, you can make the ground icy in a 20-foot-radius spread around you. Each square in that area becomes covered with ice, so it takes two squares of movement to enter each square, and the DC of Balance and Tumble checks there increases by 5. A DC 10 Balance check is required to run or charge across the ice. The ice remains for 1 minute or until exposed to fi re. You can't use this feat if you aren't touching the ground, and it doesn't work if the air temperature is above 100 degrees.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Residual Rebound	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to spell resistance or spell turning spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:If you roll a natural 20 on a save against a targeted spell, it turns back on the caster as if affected by a spell turning spell. Unlike spell turning, however, the Residual Rebound feat potentially functions against touch range spells as well. Residual Rebound only works on targeted spells that allow a saving throw, so a fireball won't rebound, nor will a power word stun.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Stench of the Dead	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Spelltouched	VISIBLE:YES																		PRETEXT:Exposure to ghoul touch or vampiric touch spell.	PREVAREQ:UA_VAR_USESPELLTOUCHED,1			DESC:You exude a carrion stench that causes any creature adjacent to you to make a Fortitude save (DC 12 + your Cha modifier) or become sickened as long as it remains adjacent to you and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. You can't suppress the stench voluntarily.																	SOURCEPAGE:UA
