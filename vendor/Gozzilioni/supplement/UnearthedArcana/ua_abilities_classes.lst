Wild Empathy	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.DruidClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A druid can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4: Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or a girallon), but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. A druidic avenger takes a -4 penalty on wild empathy checks.

Due to his extensive study on his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored enemies against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies. Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2. If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger's bonuses do not stack he simply uses whichever bonus is higher. See the Monster Manual for more information on types of creatures.

This bonus applies only to the spells listed for the domain, not all spells of the school or subtype whose name matches the domain name. In some cases, an arcane domain includes spells not normally on the wizard's class spell list.

Favored Enemy	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.DruidClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, a druid may select a type of creature from among those given on Table 3-14: Druid Favored Enemies. Due to his extensive study on his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the druid gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the druid may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example, a 5th-level druid has two favored enemies against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies. Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2. If the druid chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the druid's bonuses do not stack he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:ACF	TYPE:AlternateClassFeatures.FighterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a fighter can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, the fighter's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the fighter flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two fighter levels thereafter. Should the fighter score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. (See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for combat situations in which the fighter flanks an opponent or the opponent loses his Dexterity bonus to AC.) Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. A fighter can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range. With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a fighter can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute a sneak attack. (See Nonlethal Damage, page 146.) A fighter can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The fighter must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A fighter cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment (see page 152) or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

Blood Component	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedSorcererClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A tainted sorcerer must use blood in place of any spell's material component (if the spell has no material component, ignore this cost). She has two choices for a source of blood: herself or someone else. If she uses her own blood, the minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of damage to the tainted sorcerer, but the character does not need to make a Concentration check to successfully cast the spell, despite the wound. Substituting blood for a costly material component requires drawing a greater amount of blood. A tainted sorcerer deals more damage to herself when drawing a large amount of blood, as shown on the table below. Also, when using blood to replace a costly component in this way, the tainted sorcerer must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + damage taken + spell level) to successfully cast the spell. If the tainted sorcerer draws someone else's blood to use as a material component, the rules given above generally apply. If the source of blood is willing (or helpless) and is adjacent to the tainted sorcerer, she can make a minor knife cut to obtain a small amount of blood as a free action during the casting of the spell. (If the source is not willing or helpless and not adjacent, how long it takes to draw blood depends entirely on the circumstances.) No single source of blood can be used to replace a costly material component unless the character or creature's current hit point total is high enough to absorb all the damage without falling below -10. For example, the blood of an orc with 6 hit points remaining is not suffi cient to replace a component that costs 301 gp or more, because the orc  cannot take the necessary 17 points of damage before it is dead.

Taint Suppression	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedSorcererClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:While a tainted sorcerer is likely to accumulate a high taint score over the course of her life, this taint is not immediately obvious to onlookers. A tainted sorcerer's taint manifests in mental effects'insanity, rage, and nightmaresand in internal physical effects. If a tainted sorcerer is split open, the character's internal corruption is obvious: Her body is full of bloody pus and strange growths, even internal limbs. If a tainted sorcerer enters a tainted area, her corruption immediately manifests externally as well. Barring these two conditions, it is impossible to detect a tainted sorcerer based on appearance. A tainted sorcerer no longer applies her taint score as a penalty to her Constitution, and only applies one-half her taint score as a penalty to her Wisdom.	KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Taint Suppression																										SORTKEY:Class_Tainted_Sorcerer	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Tainted Metamagic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedSorcererClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A tainted sorcerer who learns metamagic feats can apply them by paying an additional cost in blood. By draining blood, a tainted sorcerer can enhance her spells without using a higher-level spell slot. The cost is a number of points of Constitution damage equal to the spell slot adjustment of the metamagic feat. Thus, casting an empowered vampiric touch spell costs a tainted sorcerer 2 points of Constitution damage, because an empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than normal. A tainted sorcerer cannot enhance a spell to a level higher than she can cast by this means. For example, a tainted sorcerer must be at least a 9th-level caster to cast an empowered vampiric touch spell (or at least 10th level, if the character is casting as a sorcerer), since the empowered spell requires a 5th-level spell slot. A tainted sorcerer without a Constitution score cannot use this ability.	KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Tainted Metamagic																										SORTKEY:Class_Tainted_Sorcerer	SOURCEPAGE:UA	
Tainted Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedSorcererClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Rather than using a key ability score for spellcasting, a tainted sorcerer uses her taint score. To cast a spell, a tainted sorcerer must have a taint score at least equal to the spells level. Tainted sorcerer bonus spells are based on a number equal to the character's taint score + 10, and saving throws against tainted sorcerer spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the tainted sorcerers taint score. A tainted sorcerer accumulates taint for casting her spells. All spells a tainted sorcerer casts are evil spells. She must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level) or increase her taint score by 1.

Level Advancement	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedSorcererClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The power of taint is seductive. Once a character has tasted its attractions, it is hard to resist. Whenever a tainted sorcerer gains a new level and wishes to advance a level in some other class, she must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + taint score). If she fails the saving throw, she must advance her tainted sorcerer level. If she succeeds on this saving throw, she can advance a level in some other class.

Taint Suppression	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedWarriorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:By definition, a tainted warrior is overwhelmed with taint, but this taint is not immediately obvious to onlookers. A tainted sorcerers taint manifests in mental effectsdelirium, anger, and crueltyand in internal physical effects. If a tainted warrior is split open, the internal corruption is obvious: His body is full of vile liquids and distorted growths, even internal limbs. If a tainted warrior enters a tainted area, his corruption immediately manifests externally as well. Barring these two conditions, it is impossible to detect a tainted warrior based on appearance. A tainted warrior no longer applies his taint score as a penalty to his Constitution, and only applies one-half his taint score as a penalty to his Wisdom.

Damage Reduction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedWarriorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a tainted warrior gains damage reduction 1/good.

Tainted Strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TaintedWarriorClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A tainted warrior of 3rd level or higher can infuse a melee attack with the power of his taint. The character adds his taint score to the damage dealt by the melee attack, and the targets taint score increases by 1. If a tainted warrior strikes a creature immune to the effects of taint (such as an undead creature or a creature with the evil subtype), the tainted strike has no effect. A tainted warrior can use this ability once per day upon attaining 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four levels gained thereafter.
