This ability enables it to discern objects and creatures within 120 feet. The bat usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight.

There is no limit to the number of elementals that a weird can control. Once under the weird's control, an elemental serves the weird until either it or the weird dies, until the weird dismisses it, or until the duration for its summoning expires. It obeys the weird explicitly, even if ordered to attack the being who originally summoned it. The weird does not need to concentrate to maintain control over any elemental it commands.|ElementalCommandDC	KEY:Elemental Weird ~ Elemental Command				DEFINE:ElementalCommandDC|0					BONUS:VAR|ElementalCommandDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|ElementalCommandDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Elemental Command)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Elemental Command									SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Elemental Pool	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ElementalWeirdSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Each weird dwells within a large pool (at least 20 feet across and 40 feet deep) filled with the purest form of its element. The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Three times per day, the weird can summon forth 2d4 huge elementals, 1d2 greater elementals, or 1 elder elemental through this portal. Any nonelemental creature entering a pool without the weird's permission must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 20) each round or be irrevocably transformed into the elemental material of the pool. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird are not subject to transformation. However, creatures allowed to enter a pool must still provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment.Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry.

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaggamoffynSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a raggamoffyn hits an opponent that is its own size or smaller with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus varies; see individual descriptions). If it gets a hold, it can attempt to wrap (see below) in the next round. Alternatively, the raggamoffyn has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its appendage to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the raggamoffyn is not considered grappled).

Wrap	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaggamoffynSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:With a successful grapple check, a raggamoffyn can wrap itself around any foe it has already grabbed with another successful grapple check. The monster forms a skintight layer around the wrapped creature, covering it from head to toe but leaving enough space for the creature to breathe through its mouth and nose. Attacks on such a target deal half their damage to the monster and half to the wrapped creature. An affected creature can extract itself by making a successful grapple check. Once it has wrapped a creature, the raggamoffyn can attempt to control it on its next action.	KEY:Raggamoffyn ~ Wrap																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the gizzard and return to the roc's beak, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 20) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cloud ray can swallow a snatched opponent that is Huge or smaller by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +61). The cloud ray, however, has no appreciable stomach. Instead it has a long throat, the whole length of which is equipped with teeth for grinding and tearing food. Its throat empties directly into its intestines, so the ray must chew its food thoroughly to ensure proper digestion. Once inside the ray's throat, the opponent takes 3d10+22 points of bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage per round from its teeth and muscular contractions. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the throat and return to the ray's mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the throat (AC 12) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A corpse gatherer can swallow a grabbed opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +39). The creature need not use its mouth to swallow; it can merely stuff the opponent into any convenient portion of its porous body. Once inside the gatherer, the opponent takes 1d12+12 points of bludgeoning damage per round from the roiling corpses, gravestones, and other objects inside the creature's body. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to extract itself from the hands of the corpses inside the gatherer and return to the surface of the gatherer's body, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the corpse gatherer (AC 14) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, the other nearby corpses close the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

The area within this field is under the effect of a double-strength desecrate spell (caster level 15th), as if the corpse gatherer were a permanent feature dedicated to its own deity. Each turning attempt within this area has a -6 profane penalty. Further, each undead creature in the area (including the corpse gatherer) is entitled to a +2 profane bonus on its attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws, as well as +2 hit points per HD.

Zombie Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Upon reaching 0 hit points, the corpse gatherer falls apart into its component corpses. The creature's animating force remains among the corpses that formerly composed its body, converting them into zombies. Upon its death, a corpse gatherer generates as many zombies as it has Hit Dice (that is, a 30-HD corpse-gatherer becomes thirty zombies).

A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the gullet and return to the mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the digestive tract (AC 12) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

Body Equilibrium	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TrueDragonAmethystDragonRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.PsiLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, the dragon can adjust its body equilibrium to correspond with any solid or liquid. Thus, it can walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider's web without sinking or breaking through. (This does not confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs.) Movement is at normal speed, but running on a fragile, mushy, or liquid surface requires a Dexterity check (DC 10 or more, depending on the surface) to avoid breaking through. Falling damage is halved while this power is in effect. Body equilibrium lasts 1 minute per age category. (When using the Psionics Handbook, replace this ability with the psionic power body equilibrium.)	KEY:Dragon (Amethyst Dragon) ~ Body Equilibrium																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

In addition to the effects described, an amethyst great wyrm can use the combat maneuver application of telekinesis, using its Hit Dice as its caster level.

Infuse	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EffigyRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When an effigy hits a humanoid or monstrous humanoid that is no more than two size categories larger than itself with its incorporeal touch attack, the opponent must make a successful Will save (DC %1) or become infused with the effigy's spirit. The effects of infusion on the opponent are similar to those of a magic jar spell, except as noted here. Upon infusion, the effigy gains control of the infused creature. While infused, it uses the body's physical ability scores but its own mental ability scores. It also uses whatever attack forms the subject has available. Such attacks still do 2d6 points of additional fire damage, but they do not bestow negative levels. An infused effigy automatically deals fire damage and inflicts energy drain on its host body each round. The subject dies upon reaching -10 hit points or dropping below 1st level. At that point, the body becomes a flaming corpse. Each round after infusion occurs, the subject must make an opposed Wisdom check against the effigy. Success casts the effigy out, forcing it to retreat 30 feet. Thereafter, it may not attempt to infuse the same target again for 1 round per point of difference between the check results. A failed save leaves the effigy in control of the body. If an effigy is turned while infused in a host, it abandons the body to flee.|EffigyDC	KEY:Effigy ~ Infuse				DEFINE:EffigyDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EffigyDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|EffigyDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Infuse)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Infuse									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Assume Identity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DoppelgangerEtherealRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An ethereal doppelganger can absorb another creature's mind, memories, and personality. This process requires 1 hour of unbroken physical contact per level or Hit Die of the subject. The target may attempt a Will save (DC %1); if that is successful, the process is negated and the ethereal doppelganger must begin again. A willing creature can choose to waive the saving throw. After consuming the target creature's identity, the ethereal doppelganger can assume its form with 100%% accuracy. The doppelganger possesses the other creature's memories, plus its alignment and all of its abilities, except for cleric spells of 2nd level or higher, a paladin's special abilities, and other powers granted by deities. (This does not deprive the subject of those memories or abilities; it only duplicates them in the ethereal doppelganger). The doppelganger retains its own damage resistance, darkvision, fast healing, and spell resistance in its new form. If an ethereal doppelganger commits an act that runs counter to its new identity's alignment, it is immediately forced back into its natural form for 1d10 rounds. It still retains the basic memories of the assumed identity, though not the deeper memories. If the subject dies before the contract is complete, the ethereal doppelganger immediately reverts to its natural form and loses all of that subject's memories and abilities.|AssumeIdentityDC	KEY:Doppelganger (Ethereal) ~ Assume Identity				DEFINE:AssumeIdentityDC|0					BONUS:VAR|AssumeIdentityDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|AssumeIdentityDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Assume Identity)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Assume Identity									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

A successful Will save (DC %1) negates the attempt; failure leaves the subject mentally paralyzed. A brain-locked creature is not stunned, so attackers get no special advantage against it. Furthermore, it can still defend itself against attacks (its Dexterity bonus to AC, if any, still applies), but it cannot move or initiate any actions. A brain lock can negate various forms of special movement and cause harm to the creature thereby. For example, a brain-locked flying creature falls because it cannot flap its wings, and a brain-locked swimming creature may drown because it can no longer move its limbs. The effect lasts 20 rounds, but it can be dismissed earlier.|AssumeIdentityDC	KEY:Doppelganger (Ethereal) ~ Brain Lock				DEFINE:BrainLockDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BrainLockDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|BrainLockDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Brain Lock)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Brain Lock									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

It expels these creatures from its mouth with a great belching sound. The demons arrive unharmed, but the fiendwurm's pain may cause it to attack them thereafter, if they seem to be easier prey than the opponents, or if there are no other creatures left to eat. Roll d%% to determine the kind of demons that arrive: &nl;01-50 jovocs, &nl;51-75 quasits,&nl;76-100 vrocks.

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FiendwurmRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a fiendwurm hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +49). If it gets a hold, it can try to swallow the opponent in the next round. Alternatively, the fiendwurm has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the fiendwurm is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals bite damage.	KEY:Fiendwurm ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FiendwurmRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiendwurm can swallow a grabbed opponent that is at least two size categories smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +49). Once inside the fiendwurm, the opponent takes 2d8+13 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d8 points of acid damage per round from the creature's gizzard. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the gizzard and return to the fiendwurm's mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 20) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan fiendwurm's gizzard can hold 2Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.	KEY:Fiendwurm ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Acidic Hide	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FiendwurmRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiendwurm produces a highly caustic mucus that coats its entire body.

Portal	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FiendwurmRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Lining the lowest part of the fiendwurm's gizzard is a portal to the Abyss that is activated by the presence of a living creature. A swallowed creature must make a Reflex save (DC %1) each round to avoid falling into or being squeezed through the portal. The Abyssal side of the portal is stationary, but the other side moves with the fiendwurm.

An attached fire bat is effectively grappling its prey. The fire bat loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (giving it an AC of 13) but holds on with great tenacity, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage each round it remains attached. An attached fire bat can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself.

If it gets a hold, it transfers the opponent to its mouth as a free action and automatically hits with its bite attack in the same round. It can then try to swallow its prey in the next round. Alternatively, the forest sloth has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the forest sloth is not considered grappled).

Once inside the sloth, the opponent takes 2d4+7 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 points of acid damage per round from the sloth's gullet. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the gullet and return to the sloth's mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the gullet (AC 13) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

For each round that its hit points (including temporary ones) exceed its normal hit point total, the target creature must make a successful Fortitude save (DC %1) or explode in a 20-foot burst of radiant energy. Each creature caught in the blast (including the target) takes damage equal to 2d6 points + the number of excess hit points the target had at the time.

Death Fog	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreenviseRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Twice per day, a greenvise can emit an acidic fog that functions like an acid fog spell, except as follows. The death fog's area is a 40-foot high spread with a 60-foot radius. Within this area, all sight, including darkvision, is limited to 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has onehalf concealment (attacks against it have a 20%% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50%% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Any creature attempting to move through the death fog progresses at one-tenth normal speed, and each of its melee attack and melee damage rolls incurs a -2 circumstance penalty. A death fog prevents effective ranged weapon attacks, except for magic rays and the like. In addition to obscuring sight, a death fog is highly acidic. Each round, the fog deals 3d8 points of acid damage to every creature and object within it (no saving throw). A severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors in 1d2 rounds; otherwise, the effect lasts for 3d6+1 rounds.

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreenviseRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a greenvise hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +26). If it gets a hold, it can transfer the opponent to its maw with another successful grapple check, dealing automatic bite damage, then try to swallow in the next round. Alternatively, the greenvise has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tendrils or maw to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the greenvise is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals slam or bite damage, as appropriate.	KEY:Gravecrawler ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreenviseRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A greenvise can swallow a single creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +26), provided it already has that opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the greenvise, the opponent takes 2d6+9 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d4 points of acid damage per round from the plant's stomach. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the greenvise's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 20 points of damage to the stomach (AC 14) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A greenvise's stomach can hold 1 Large, 4 Medium-size, 16 Small, or 64 Tiny or smaller opponents.	KEY:Gravecrawler ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LegendaryAnimalLegendarySharkRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A legendary shark can swallow a Large or smaller creature by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +39), provided it already has that opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the legendary shark, the opponent takes 2d8+13 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8+4 points of acid damage per round from the shark's stomach. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the legendary shark's mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the stomach (AC 18) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A legendary shark's stomach can hold up to 2 Large, 8 Medium-size, 32 Small, or 128 Tiny or smaller opponents.

The monster's interior contains a mass of surging water. Each swallowed creature must make a Swim check (DC 15) every round. Success means the swallowed creature takes 1d3 points of subdual damage but can attack the leviathan from inside with any weapon other than a bow or crossbow. Failure means the swallowed creature takes 1d6 points of subdual damage and must immediately make a second Swim check (DC 15) to avoid going underwater and starting to drown. Anyone attacking the leviathan from the inside hits automatically. If the leviathan takes 50 points of damage from the inside, it disgorges the entire contents of its stomach.	KEY:Leviathan ~ Gulp																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Ramming	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LeviathanRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once every 12 rounds, a leviathan can move at up to 720 feet and ram a Large or smaller creature or any sort of ship. To ram, the leviathan must end its movement in the target's space. If the target is a ship, the creature always precedes this attack with a long surface approach so everyone aboard can see what's coming. This attack deals 8d6+%2 points of damage. If the target is a creature, it can attempt either an attack of opportunity or a Reflex save (DC %1) for half damage. Upon ramming a ship, the leviathan can make a Strength check to breach its hull, which causes it to sink in 1d10 minutes. The break DC varies with the type of vessel rammed, as follows: rowboat DC 20, keelboat DC 23, sailing ship or longship DC 25, warship DC 27, or galley DC 30. (See Chapter 5 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide for information about ships.) Regardless of the check result, every creature aboard must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC 15). Success means the creature takes 1d10 points of damage from being thrown about by the impact; failure means the creature is hurled overboard.|RammingDC|STR*3/2	KEY:Leviathan ~ Ramming				DEFINE:RammingDC|0					BONUS:VAR|RammingDC|DefaultDCStr	BONUS:VAR|RammingDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Ramming)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Ramming									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

This causes any sailing vessel within 300 feet to capsize if the character steering it fails a Profession (sailor) check (DC 15). A modifier applies to this check based on the type of ship, as follows: rowboat -2, warship +0, galley or keelboat +3, sailing ship +5, longship +7. Any creature flung into the water by a capsizing ship must succeed at a Swim check (DC 15) or immediately begin drowning.

Any creature within the area that fails a Will save (DC %1) becomes catatonic from fear for 1d4+4 rounds. During this time, it rolls into a ball, hugs its knees, or simply stands in place, shivering and staring.

Meenlock Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MeenlockRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Meenlocks drag their victims to their lairs and bind them to prevent their escape before starting the transformation. (A captured creature may be able to escape from its bonds and fight its way clear, but the odds are against it, especially since the height of the mazelike tunnels in a meenlock lair forces a Medium-size creature to crawl on hands and knees.)Then three or more of them gather around to touch each helpless humanoid or monstrous humanoid. After 1d6 hours of such physical contact with the meenlocks, all of the subject's ability scores fall to 1 (except for any already at 0), reducing him or her to a drooling, helpless state (no saving throw). A heal or greater restoration spell at this point restores the creature to normal. In another 1d6 hours, the transformation is complete; the subject becomes forever a meenlock, losing all of its previous classes and abilities. At this point, only a wish or miracle spell can restore the victim.	KEY:Meenlock ~ Meenlock Transformation																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

These thoughts are usually geared to cause paranoia-images of stalking monsters or peering eyes, and the sensation of being followed, watched, or sized up. The target of this mindaffecting phantasm must make a successfulWill save (DC %1) or take 1d4 points ofWisdom damage.Once a meenlock uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so again.|RendMindDC	KEY:Meenlock ~ Rend Mind				DEFINE:RendMindDC|0					BONUS:VAR|RendMindDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|RendMindDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Rend Mind)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Rend Mind									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

If it gets a hold, it can try to swallow on the next round. Alternatively, the megalodon has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the megalodon is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals bite damage.	KEY:Megalodon ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MegalodonRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A megalodon can swallow a single creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +40), provided it already has that opponent in its mouth (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the megalodon, the opponent takes 2d8+10 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8+4 points of acid damage per round from the megalodon's gullet. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the gullet and return to the monster's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the gullet (AC 20) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan megalodon's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller opponents.	KEY:Megalodon ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OrcwortRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An orcwort can swallow a Huge or smaller creature by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +54), provided it already has that opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the orcwort's pitcher, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of acid damage per round and is subject to the paralyzing effect of its digestive juices (see Paralysis, above). A successful grapple check allows a swallowed creature to climb out of the pitcher (assuming it is not paralyzed) and return to the orcwort'smaw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 20 points of damage to the pitcher (AC 16) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The orcwort's pitcher can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.	KEY:Orcwort ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Blade of Fury	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RagewindRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Three times per day, a ragewind can expand itself outward into a 15-foot-radius spread, filling that entire space with its whirling weapons. This attack deals 20d6 points of slashing damage to every creature within that area (Reflex DC %1 half ). Immediately after this attack, the ragewind reverts to its normal size and shape.

Whirlwind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RagewindRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ragewind can intensify the swirling air that composes its usual form to the strength of a whirlwind as a free action.

Each creature that is at least two size categories smaller than the ragewind and in contact with it must succeed at a Reflex save (DC %4) or take %2d%3 points of damage. Whether or not this save is successful, an affected creature must immediately make a second Reflex save against the same DC. Failure indicates that the affected creature is picked up by the winds and takes an additional 1d8 points of damage that round and each round thereafter that it remains suspended in the winds. (The ragewind may also direct weapon attacks at creatures caught within its whirlwind if desired, though it gains no special bonuses for doing so). A flying creature may leave the whirlwind with a successful Reflex save, though it still takes damage for the round in which it does so. A ragewind may also cause its whirlwind  to touch the ground, kicking up a swirling cloud of debris with a 10-foot radius. This cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures at a distance of 5 feet have one-half concealment, and those farther away have total concealment.

Devour Mind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ReasonStealerRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A reason stealer transfers an opponent's Intelligence score to itself upon dealing it a killing blow with a slam attack. This process also heals the monster of 5 points of damage per point of Intelligence gained. Upon devouring a mind, the reason stealer has access to any of the dead opponent's other ability scores, skill ranks, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses, and it can use any of these characteristics that are higher than its own. It also gains the use of the opponent's feats and any prepared arcane spells. The reason stealer understands that it must remove spell components from a victim's body to cast spells. All these acquired features last for 24 hours. If a reason stealer devours the mind of a victim while it still has the abilities of a previous one, it uses the higher of the two (the new victim's or its current value) for ability scores, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and skill ranks. It also gains any feats and spells possessed by the new victim that it did not already have.	KEY:Reason Stealer ~ Devour Mind																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

If it gets a hold, it has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its pseudopod to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the reason stealer is not considered grappled).

Any creature or object that makes physical contact with the monster is smeared with this sticky acid, which deals 1d6 points of acid damage per round until removed. Thus, any successful hit from or against the red sundew automatically deals acid damage to the opponent or the opponent's weapon, depending upon the point of contact. Sticky acid remains on a creature or object for 1d4+1 rounds. It cannot be scraped off, but it can be washed off with a full-round action and at least 1 gallon of water.

An affected creature immediately attacks its closest ally, using the best tactics and items at its disposal. This murderous frenzy prevents spellcasting but not the activation of magic items that require spell completion, and it lasts for 3d6 rounds.

The disk automatically recharges itself to full power every night, at midnight. A spell powered by the disk is cast as though the caster had the Spell Focus feat for the spell in question. Only a spell weaver can utilize a chromatic disk.

Entropic Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TeratomorphRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The entropic energy that surges through a teratomorph's shapeless body causes horrible transformations in living creatures that come into contact with it. If a creature struck by a teratomorph's slam attack fails a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1), its body transforms in some way, causing one of the following effects:&nl;1d20/Result&nl;1-7 Physical Mutation. The touch of the teratomorph transforms the opponent's anatomy, resulting in 1d6 points of Strength drain or Dexterity drain (50%% chance for each).&nl;8-13 Tissue Annihilation. The touch of the ooze causes tiny portions of the opponent's anatomy to vanish, resulting in 2d4 points of Constitution drain. &nl;14-18 Transformation. The opponent undergoes a transformation as though affected by a polymorph any object spell (caster level 20th). This painful process deals 5d20 points of subdual damage. The DM can randomly determine the subject's new form or choose a particular form. &nl;19 Bonding. The ooze sticks to the target and automatically succeeds at a grapple check. Each round thereafter, the teratomorph can attempt a new grapple check (grapple bonus +44) to deal 4d6+16 points of bludgeoning damage. The opponent must succeed at a new Fortitude saving throw (DC %1) each round that the teratomorph deals damage to avoid further effects from the entropic touch. (If this result comes up more than once, roll again.) &nl;20 Absorption. The opponent is entirely absorbed by the ooze. An absorbed creature dies instantly and leaves behind no trace of a body, so only a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell can restore it to life.

Warp Reality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TeratomorphRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The potent chaotic energy that surges through and out of a teratomorph's body can have amazing effects on the surrounding terrain. When the monster is at rest, this energy is calm, but when the monster moves or attacks, the energy lashes out in a 120-foot emanation. These ripples of chaos cause the surrounding terrain to warp and writhe, imposing a -4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and Dexterity checks for all creatures in the area except the teratomorph. Every round that this reality warp persists, there is a 10%% chance that the chaotic energy manifests in a more dramatic manner. Such chaos manifestations duplicate spell effects. Roll 1d20 and refer to the appropriate line on the following table to determine the spells effects produced.

If it gets a hold, it can try to swallow in the next round.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WindghostRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A windghost can swallow a single creature that is at least two size categories smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +30), provided it already has that opponent in its mouth (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the windghost, the opponent takes 1d8+4 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d6+2 points of acid damage per round from the monster's stomach. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the windghost's mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the stomach (AC 13) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

Body Meld	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YakFolkRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day a yak folk can merge its body with that of a humanoid or giant of Small to Large size. Except where noted here, this power functions like a magic jar spell heightened to 9th level (caster level 20th; Will save DC %1 negates). To use this ability, the yak folk must touch the intended target for 20 minutes without interruption (yak folk usually restrain their victims while using this ability). At the end of this period, the target must make a Will save to remain conscious. On a failed save, the host's mind becomes unconscious, and the yak folk assumes control. There is no magic jar per se-the yak folk physically merges its body with the victim's body without the use of an intermediate vessel. Body meld lasts until dispelled or dismissed. The process works only on humans, elves, dwarves, halforcs, and any creature of the giant type. The yak folk shares all the victim's knowledge, memories, skills, feats, and extraordinary abilities, but none of its spell-like or supernatural abilities. The yak folk retains all of its own supernatural and spell-like abilities. The merging does not shed a magical aura (so a detect magic spell does not reveal it), but a true seeing spell reveals the victim's dual nature. If the host body is slain, the yak folk dies with it. Separating the two bodies takes half as long as melding (10 minutes). The host regains consciousness 1d6 minutes after the separation is complete. Only characters who know the victim personally have any chance to realize that something is wrong, by making a Spot check opposed by the yak folk's Disguise check (which in this case represents how well the yak folk impersonates its host).|BodyMeldDC	KEY:Yak Folk ~ Body Meld				DEFINE:BodyMeldDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BodyMeldDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|BodyMeldDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Body Meld)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Body Meld									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

The janni is a slave bound to serve until the second sunrise after the summoning. The yak folk are greatly disliked by all genies, but for reasons lost in antiquity, no genie can attack a yak folk. Genies sometimes work to thwart the yak folk's plans or disrupt their lives in other, indirect ways, but even this is done cautiously because the genies know that if they antagonize the yak folk too much, the lives of enslaved jann will only become worse and their tasks more onerous.
