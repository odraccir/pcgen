Berserk	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GolemHalfFleshRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a Cumulative 1%% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk.

Immunity To Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GolemHalfFleshRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.

For example, a flesh golem hit by a lightning bolt heals 3 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 11 points of damage. A flesh golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.	KEY:Golem (Half/Flesh) ~ Immunity To Magic																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Immunity To Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GolemHalfClayRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A clay golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A move earth spell drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it. A disintegrate spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage. An earth uake spell cast directly at a clay golem stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage. The golem gets no saving throw against any of these effects. Any magical attack against a clay golem that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a clay golem hit by the breath weapon of a black dragon heals 7 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 22 points of damage. A clay golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid Damage.	KEY:Golem (Half/Clay) ~ Immunity To Magic																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, an iron golem hit by a fireball gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 18 points. An iron golem gets no saving throw against fire effects. An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
