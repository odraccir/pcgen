However, the grafted creature can use the ghostly arm to deliver an incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, the equivalent of a ghost's corrupting touch attack. Treat the arm as a secondary weapon, but because it is incorporeal the arm has no Strength score and therefore gains no bonus or penalty on damage rolls from the user's Strength.
Graft (Mohrg's Tongue)		TYPE:Graft.Undead	COST:24000	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:LM	SPROP:This long, cartilaginous tongue bears sharp claws at its tip.

A living creature touched must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+2 minutes. Elves are immune to this paralyzing touch. A touch that misses does not count against the daily limit.	BONUS:STAT|STR|4|TYPE=Inherent
Graft (Skeletal Hand)		TYPE:Graft.Undead	COST:3000	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:LM	SPROP:The grafted creature can use this bony hand to make claw attacks. The damage dealt is the same as that dealt by a skeleton of the creature's size.
