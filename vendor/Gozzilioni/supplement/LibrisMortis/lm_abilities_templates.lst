Bloodcurling Howl	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostBrutespecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The mournful howling of a ghost brute chills the living to the core. The creature can howl as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot radius must make a successful Will save DC %1 or become frightened for 2d4 rounds; those more than 30 feet away but within 300 feet must make a Will save DC %1 or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, necromantic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the bloodcurdling howl cannot be affected by the same ghost brute's howl for 24 hours.|BloodcurlingHowlDC	KEY:forsaken Shell ~ Bloodcurling Howl				DEFINE:BloodcurlingHowlDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BloodcurlingHowlDC|GhostBruteDC	BONUS:VAR|BloodcurlingHowlDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Bloodcurling Howl)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Bloodcurling Howl									SOURCEPAGE:LM
Corrupting touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostBrutespecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost brute that hits a living target with its corrupting touch attack deals 1d4 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifi er to attack rolls and damage rolls. Against material opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifi er to attack rolls only.	KEY:forsaken Shell ~ Corrupting Touch																											SOURCEPAGE:LM
Loom	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostBrutespecialAttack.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost brute can make itself more intimidating by exaggerating its natural size. It can appear up to two sizes larger than normal for a total of 10 minutes each day (the time need not be continuous). This enlargement is illusory; the creature's attack bonus and Armor Class remain unchanged. However, a ghost brute gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks while enlarged.

Slavering Doom	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostBrutespecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost brute's jaws drip with a glowing ectoplasmic drool that exists in both ethereal and corporeal form. The ectoplasm dissipates on contact with nonliving material, but if it touches a living being, that opponent must make a successful Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of negative energy damage. The drool can be delivered through a bite attack against an ethereal opponent, or a melee touch attack against an opponent on the Material Plane. Alternatively, the drool can simply be sprayed onto a nearby creature as a ranged touch attack.	KEY:forsaken Shell ~ Slavering Doom																											SOURCEPAGE:LM
Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostBruteRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As ethereal creatures, ghost brutes cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When they manifest, ghost brutes become visible but remain incorporeal. However, a manifested ghost brute can strike with a touch attack, if it has one, or a ghost touch weapon (if it can wield a weapon). A manifested ghost brute remains on the Ethereal Plane but can be attacked by opponents on both the Material and Ethereal planes.	KEY:Ghost Brute ~ Manifestation																											SOURCEPAGE:LM
Rejuvenation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostBruteRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In most cases, it is diffi cult to destroy a ghost brute through simple combat. The "destroyed" spirit often restores itself in 2d4 days. A ghost brute that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost brute's HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only defi nitive way to get rid of a ghost brute is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research. Unlike other more intelligent spirits, a ghost brute is usually tied more closely to other beings. Often it is the companion of a ghostly being, but it may also become fascinated with or enraged by a living creature that intrudes on its domain. It always returns to the object of its attachment rather than to a set location.	KEY:Ghost Brute ~ Rejuvenation																											SOURCEPAGE:LM

An affl icted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the fl esh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects.

Blood Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HalfVampireSpecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Some half-vampires can suck blood from a living victim with their fangs by making a successful grapple check. If the half-vampire pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. A half-vampire can't drain more points of Constitution in a single hour than its Constitution score. When a half-vampire drains a victim's Constitution, it gains 5 temporary hit points, no matter how many points it drains. Temporary hit points gained in this way last for up to 1 hour. If a half-vampire has this ability, it also gains the blood dependency special quality described below.

Charm Gaze	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HalfVampireSpecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Some half-vampires can charm humanoid or monstrous humanoid opponents just by looking into their eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the half-vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at the half-vampire are not affected. Anyone the half-vampire targets must make a successful Will save DC %1 or fall under the half-vampire's infl uence as though affected by a charm monster spell (caster level equal to HD). Any creature that successfully saves against a half-vampire's charm gaze cannot be affected by that halfvampire's charm gaze for 24 hours. The ability has a range of 30 feet.|CharmGazeDC	KEY:Half-Vampire ~ Charm Gaze				DEFINE:CharmGazeDC|0					BONUS:VAR|CharmGazeDC|HalfVampireDC	BONUS:VAR|CharmGazeDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Charm Gaze)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Charm Gaze									SOURCEPAGE:LM
Childrem of the Night	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HalfVampireSpecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Some half-vampires can command the lesser creatures of the world. Once per day, a half-vampire that has this special attack can call forth 1d4 rat swarms, 1d3 bat swarms, or a pack of 1d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this ability might summon other creatures of equivalent power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the half-vampire for up to 1 hour.	KEY:Half-Vampire ~ Children of the Night																											SOURCEPAGE:LM
Blood Dependency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HalfVampireSpecialQuality.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a half-vampire does not use its blood drain special attack against at least one living creature each day, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Each day after the fi rst that the half-vampire does not drink blood directly from a living creature, the DC increases by 1 until it fails the save and becomes fatigued. After that, it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each week (with the DC increasing by 1 each week thereafter) that it does not use its blood drain or become exhausted. The fatigue or exhaustion caused by blood dependency cannot be eliminated by rest (though magic can offset the condition until the vampire fails another save). Using its blood drain ability eliminates a half-vampire's fatigue immediately, or reduces exhaustion to fatigue. Only half-vampires with the blood drain special attack (see above) gain this special quality.	KEY:Half-Vampire ~ Blood Dependency																											SOURCEPAGE:LM

Drinking Blood	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HoodedPupilSpiecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a hooded pupil can suck blood from a living victim who has damage that is yet unhealed (the hooded pupil doesn't have exceptionally sharp teeth, unless the base creature has a bite attack, so it must sip from wounds). It does so by making a successful grapple check (it usually prefers to use this ability on foes that are already helpless). Against a pinned or helpless foe, it drinks blood, dealing 2 points of Constitution damage.	KEY:Hooded Pupil ~ Drinking Blood																											SOURCEPAGE:LM

Mummy Rot	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummifiedCreatureRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Supernatural disease- natural weapon, Fortitude DC %1 as above, incubation period 1 minute; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot persists until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below. Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature affl icted with mummy rot must make a DC 20 caster level check, or else the spell has no effect on the affl icted character. To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must fi rst be broken with break enchantment or remove curse (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), after which a caster level check is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease. An affl icted creature that dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand that blows away into nothing at the fi rst wind.|MummyRotDC	KEY:Mummified Creature ~ Mummy Rot				DEFINE:MummyRotDC|0					BONUS:VAR|MummyRotDC|MummifiedCreatureDC	BONUS:VAR|MummyRotDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Mummy Rot)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Mummy Rot									SOURCEPAGE:LM

A necromental can use its energy drain ability once per round, regardless of the number of natural weapon attacks the necromental possesses. The save DC to remove the negative level 24 hours later is %1. When a necromental bestows a negative level on a victim, it gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit). These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.|EnergyDrainDC	KEY:Necromental ~ Energy Drain				DEFINE:EnergyDrainDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EnergyDrainDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|EnergyDrainDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Energy Drain)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Energy Drain									SOURCEPAGE:LM
