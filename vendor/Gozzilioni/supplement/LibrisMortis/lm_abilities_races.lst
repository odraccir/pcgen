Even if brought to 0 hit points or less, a bleakborn eventually heals if a living creature at some future date wanders within 30 feet of the bleakborn's remains, automatically triggering its heat-draining aura. As long as affected creatures are within its heat-draining aura, a bleakborn's contingent healing remains active. A bleakborn does not have immunity to cold. While a bleakborn doesn't take cold damage from its own abilities, it can take cold damage from another of its kind.	KEY:Bleakborn ~ Contingent Healing																											SOURCEPAGE:LM

Each touch deals 1d4 points of Intelligence drain to the victim. When a dream vestige drains a victim's Intelligence, it gains 5 temporary hit points, no matter how many points it drains. Temporary hit points gained in this way last for up to 1 hour. Should a dream vestige ever acquire a number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points, it self spawns (see below).

Entomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EntomberRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Whenever an entomber succeeds on a slam attack, it can attempt to entomb its foe. The foe must make a DC %1 Refl ex save or be pounded bodily into a shallow grave. The save DC is Charisma-based. This ability doesn't work in locations with a basement or open level immediately below, nor can the creature entomb victims in magical, living, or animate materials, or materials with a hardness higher than 8. The upthrust bulge of cracked fl ooring material, earth, or stone reveals the location of the victim to compatriots. Two standard actions spent clearing away the broken fl ooring material reveals the entombed victim, who can use his or her next action to stand from a prone (and dusty) position. Attempting to rescue a friend in this way can provoke attacks of opportunity. The victim is treated as if pinned by an opponent (the earth) with a grappling check of 20. Breaking free of fi rst the "pin" and then the "grapple" allows the victim to stand from a prone position on his or her next round. If compatriots of the victim have partially cleared away the covering material, then the victim need only make a single check before standing from the prone position. Each round the victim spends fully or partially entombed is a round in which the victim suffocates (see Suffocation, page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).|EntombDC	KEY:Entomber ~ Entomb				DEFINE:EntombDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EntombDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|EntombDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Entomb)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Entomb									SOURCEPAGE:LM

Entropic Blade	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EntropicReaperRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An entropic reaper confers the entropic blade property upon any weapon it wields-usually a normal scythe. An entropic blade functions in all ways like the kind of weapon it is, with the following addition. Any time the entropic reaper successfully deals damage with its entropic blade, the victim must make a DC %1 Fortitude save or be overcome with searing pain, as the victim's form melts, fl ows, writhes, and boils. During this entropic state, the victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50%% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). Each round spent in this entropic state, the victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0, it discorporates into nothingness. A victim can gain control over itself by taking a standard action to attempt a DC %1 Charisma check. Success renders the victim immune from the entropic state for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful. The entropic state is not a disease or a curse, so it is hard to remove. A shapechange or stoneskin spell does not cure an affl icted creature but fi xes its state for the duration of the spell. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes the affl iction (though a separate restoration is necessary to restore any drained points of Wisdom).

Immunity To Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GolemGraveDirtRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A grave dirt golem is immune to spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, just as if the attacker had failed to overcome spell resistance. The only exceptions are as follows: A move earth spell drives the grave dirt golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage. A disintegrate spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage. An earthquake spell cast directly at a grave dirt golem stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage. The golem receives no saving throw against any of these effects. Any magical attack against a grave dirt golem that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.

Intercession	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:QuellRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A quell can cut divine spellcasters off from their source of power. To do so, the quell makes a turning check as if it were a cleric of a level equal to the quell's Hit Dice (5th level). The result indicates the highest-level divine spellcasters the quell can cut off from their deity. The turning damage result indicates the maximum total Hit Dice of divine spellcasters within 60 feet the ability can affect. The quell's intercession affects the closest divine spellcasters it can affect fi rst. Normally, affected divine spellcasters cannot turn undead or cast divine spells for 1 minute; however, if the quell has twice as many HD as the spellcaster has divine levels, the divine spellcaster loses the ability to cast divine spells for 24 hours. If the quell attacks an affected divine spellcaster in any way, or the affected spellcaster receives an atonement spell, the intercession ends. The quell's allies and other creatures can attack the divine spellcaster without breaking the intercession.

Pale Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SlaymateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A slaymate produces an invisible aura in a 10-foot radius around itself. Any creature within the aura that uses a metamagic feat on a spell from the school of necromancy can prepare or use the spell as if it took up a spell slot one level lower than what the metamagic necromancy spell would normally require. For instance, if a caster wants to produce an enlarged fear spell, the enlargement would normally require the spellcaster to prepare the spell (or cast it on the fl y) as if it were one level higher than it actually is. But, in the radius of a slaymate's pale aura, the caster prepares an enlarged fear spell as if the spell were being cast normally.	KEY:Slaymate ~ Pale Aura																											SOURCEPAGE:LM

Assume Identity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VisageRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A visage can, as a free action, take on the form of someone it has killed within the last round. A visage in an assumed identity gains a +20 bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks made to pass as the victim. It also gains profi ciency in the skills of the victim; treat this as an enhancement bonus to the skill check equal to the number of ranks the victim had in life. The visage does not gain the victim's extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities, nor does it gain any spellcasting powers of the victim. The visage retains its own ability scores, special attacks, and special qualities. This effect lasts for 24 hours, though the visage can dismiss it at will. While a visage is in the form of its victim, that victim can't be returned to life except by a true resurrection spell (which also immediately ends the effect on the visage). After 24 hours, or if the identity is dismissed, the soul is damaged, and the victim can be returned to life only by a miracle or wish spell followed by a true resurrection.
