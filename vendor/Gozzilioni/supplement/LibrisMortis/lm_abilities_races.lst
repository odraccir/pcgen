Even if brought to 0 hit points or less, a bleakborn eventually heals if a living creature at some future date wanders within 30 feet of the bleakborn’s remains, automatically triggering its heat-draining aura. As long as affected creatures are within its heat-draining aura, a bleakborn’s contingent healing remains active. A bleakborn does not have immunity to cold. While a bleakborn doesn’t take cold damage from its own abilities, it can take cold damage from another of its kind.	KEY:Bleakborn ~ Contingent Healing																											SOURCEPAGE:LM

If this amount of healing would cause bleakborn to exceed its full normal hit point total, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour. For example, a bleakborn hit by a fi reball that would normally deal 18 points of damage instead gains 6 hit points. A bleakborn makes no saving throws against fi re effects.
