Radiant Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterOfRadianceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A master of radiance can emanate an aura of brilliant light that weakens undead creatures.

Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of the bright aura. In addition, undead creatures within the radius of bright light take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Activating the radiant aura is a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While her radiant aura is active, a master of radiance casts spells with the light descriptor at +2 caster level.

A pale master can use this ability once per day at 6th level, twice per day at 8th level, and three times per day at 10th level.
