Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HexbladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Hexblades are profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for hexblade spells are simple, a hexblade can cast hexblade spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a hexblade wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (and most do). A multiclass hexblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes.

Hexblade's Curse	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HexbladeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:%1/day, as a free action, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe. The target must be visible to the hexblade and within 60 feet. The target of a hexblade's curse takes a -%3 penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 hour thereafter. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 hexblade's class level + hexblade's Cha modifier, DC %2) negates the effect. At every four levels beyond 1st (5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th) a hexblade gains the ability to use his curse one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 1-1. Multiple hexblade's curses don't stack, and any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected again by the same hexblade's curse for 24 hours. Any effect that removes or dispels a curse eliminates the effect of a hexblade's curse.|HexbladeCurseTimes|HexbladeCurseDC|HexbladeCursePenalty	KEY:Hexblade ~ Hexblade's Curse				DEFINE:HexbladeCurseDC|0	DEFINE:HexbladeCurseTimes|0	DEFINE:HexbladeCursePenalty|0			BONUS:VAR|HexbladeCurseDC|10+HexbladeLVL/2+CHA	BONUS:VAR|HexbladeCurseDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Hexblade's Curse)	BONUS:VAR|HexbladeCurseTimes|(HexbladeLVL+3)/4	BONUS:VAR|HexbladeCursePenalty|2|TYPE=Base						ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Hexblade's Curse								SORTKEY:Class_Hexblade	SOURCEPAGE:CW

Mettle	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HexbladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a hexblade can resist magical and unusual attacks with great willpower or fortitude. If he makes a successful Will or Fortitude save against an attack that normally would have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), he instead completely negates the effect. An unconscious or sleeping hexblade does not gain the benefi t of mettle.	KEY:Hexblade ~ Mettle																										SORTKEY:Class_Hexblade	SOURCEPAGE:CW	
Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HexbladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant. The hexblade chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the hexblade advances in level, his familiar also increases in power. Treat the hexblade as a sorcerer of three levels lower for determining the familiar's powers and abilities (see the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Player's Handbook). If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the  hexblade, the latter must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per hexblade level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a hexblade's  experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar  cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, but it does not  lose a level or a point of Constitution when this happy event occurs.  A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HexbladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from the hexblade spell list (see Chapter 3). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the Player's Handbook). To learn or cast a spell, a hexblade must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hexblade's spell is 10 + the spell level + the hexblade's Cha modifier. Like other spellcasters, a hexblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the  Player's Handbook). When Table 1-1 indicates that the hexblade gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for  instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level hexblade), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The hexblade's selection of spells is extremely limited. A hexblade begins play knowing no spells, but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on Table 1-2. (Unlike spells per day, his Charisma score does not affect the number of spells a  hexblade knows; the numbers on Table 1-2 are fi xed.) Upon reaching 12th level, and at every third hexblade level after that (15th and 18th), a hexblade can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he  already knows. In effect, the hexblade "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged,  and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level hexblade spell the hexblade can cast. For instance, upon reaching 12th level, a hexblade could trade in a single 1stlevel spell (two spell levels below the highest-level hexblade spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell. At 15th level, he could trade in a single 1st-level or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level hexblade spells) for a different spell of the same level. A hexblade may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. Through 3rd level, a hexblade has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his hexblade level.

Aura of Unluck	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HexbladeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a hexblade of 12th level or higher can create a baleful aura of misfortune. Any melee or ranged attack made against the hexblade while this aura of unluck is active has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effect of concealment). Activating the aura is a free action, and the aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the hexblade's Charisma bonus (if any). At 16th level and higher, a hexblade can use his aura of unluck twice per day. A 20th-level hexblade can activate this aura three times per day.

Bear Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BearWarriorClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A bear warrior can transform into a bear (similar to the polymorph spell) while in a rage or frenzy. His only limit on the number of times per day he can assume a bear form is the number of times per day he enters a rage or frenzy, and the bear warrior returns to his own form once the rage or frenzy ends. The bear warrior retains the normal +2 bonus on Will saves and -2 penalty to Armor Class while raging, but the ability score bonuses granted by rage or frenzy are replaced by Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution bonuses appropriate to the bear form taken (see below). As normal for polymorph, the bear warrior gains the bear form's physical qualities (including size, movement, natural armor bonus, natural weapons, space, and reach), as well as any ex tra ordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as improved grab in the brown bear or dire bear form). The transformation lasts for the duration of the rage or frenzy. Unlike with the polymorph spell, a bear warrior doesn't gain the bear's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores when he takes bear form, nor does he regain any hit points when he transforms. However, his current hit points increase due to his new Constitution, as normal for a rage ability. Any bear warrior can assume the form of a black bear once per day. While in black bear form, he gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and a +4 bonus to Constitution. At 5th level, a bear warrior can assume bear form twice per day and can choose between black and brown bear forms.

Any time the dark hunter's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the dark hunter's attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. Should a dark hunter score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a dark hunter can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the sneak attack. A dark hunter can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The dark hunter must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A dark hunter cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If a dark hunter gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.

If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering him helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the dark hunter.

Frenzy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FrenziedBerserkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Rage	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A frenzied berserker can enter a frenzy during combat. While frenzied, she gains a +6 bonus to Strength and, if she makes a full attack action, gains a single extra attack each round at her highest bonus. (This latter effect is not cumulative with haste or other effects that grant additional attacks.) However, she also takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and takes 2 points of nonlethal damage per round. A frenzy lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the frenzied berserker's Constitution modifi er. To end the frenzy before its duration expires, the character may attempt a DC 20 Will save once per round as a free action. Success ends the frenzy immediately; failure means it continues. The effects of frenzy stack with those from any rage ability the character may have. At 1st level, the character can enter a frenzy once per day. Thereafter, she gains one additional use per day of this ability for every two frenzied berserker levels she acquires (but she can't use the ability more than once in any encounter). The character can enter a frenzy as a free action. Even though this takes no time, she can do it only during her turn, not in response to another's action. In addition, if she takes damage from an attack, spell, trap, or any other source, she automatically enters a frenzy at the start of her next action, as long as she still has at least one daily usage of the ability left. To avoid entering a frenzy in response to a provoking effect, the character must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + points of damage taken since her last action) at the start of her next turn. While frenzied, the character cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Intimidate), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can she cast spells, drink potions, activate magic items, or read scrolls. She can use any feat she has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, or metamagic feats. She can use her special ability to inspire frenzy (see below) normally. During a frenzy, the frenzied berserker must attack those she perceives as foes to the best of her ability. Should she run out of enemies before her frenzy expires, her rampage continues. She must then attack the nearest creature (determine randomly if several potential foes are equidistant) and fi ght that opponent without regard to friendship, innocence, or health (the target's or her own). When a frenzy ends, the frenzied berserker is fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity, unable to charge or run) for the duration of the encounter. If the character is still under the effect of a rage ability, the fatigued condition does not apply until the rage ends-at which point the character is exhausted, not merely fatigued.

Defensive Strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GnomeGiantSlayerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 10th-level gnome giant-slayer can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than he otherwise would. Once per day, when he would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow struck by a giant, not a spell or special ability), he can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, he makes a Refl ex saving throw (DC = damage dealt; the gnome giant-slayer adds his class level as a bonus on this saving throw). If the save succeeds, he takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, he takes full damage. He must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute his defensive roll-if he is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, he cant use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Refl ex save for half damage, the characters evasion or improved evasion ability (if applicable) does not apply to the defensive roll.

Evasion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HalflingOutriderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Evasion	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 7th level, a halfl ing outrider gains the evasion ability. If she makes a successful Refl ex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the halfl ing outrider is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless halfl ing outrider (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefi t of the Ability.
