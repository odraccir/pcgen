Cavalry Charger	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:6		PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mounted Combat,Spirited Charge,Trample																		DESC:The Cavalry Charger feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Unhorse: To use this maneuver, you must be mounted and charge a mounted foe. If your charge attack hits, you may make a free bull rush attempt. If the bull rush attempt succeeds, you move your foe normally, but his mount remains where it was. Leaping Charge: To use this maneuver, you must be mounted and charge a foe at least one size category smaller than your mount. Make a Ride check at the conclusion of the move portion of the charge action. Prior to making the roll, determine the DC of the check: either DC 10 for a chance to deal 2 extra points of damage or DC 20 for a chance to deal 4 extra points of damage. If you fail this Ride check, you miss your target (no attack roll) and if you fail this Ride check by 5 or more, you miss your target and fall off your mount, landing in a square adjacent to the mount's space. Fell Trample: You can make mounted overrun attempts against more than one foe, resolving each attempt according to the rules on page 157 and 158 of the Player's Handbook. Your mount gets a hoof attack against each foe you successfully overrun.																	SOURCEPAGE:CW		
Combat Brute	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:6		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved sunder,Power Attack																		DESC:The Combat Brute feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Advancing Blows: To use this maneuver, you must make a successful bull rush attempt against a foe. During the next round, all your attacks against that foe gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls for each square your bull rush moved that foe. For example, if you pushed an orc back 10 (2 squares) feet with a bull rush, you would gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against that orc on the following round. Sundering Cleave: To use this maneuver, you must destroy a foe's weapon or shield with a successful sunder attempt (see page 158 of the Player's Handbook). If you do so, you gain an immediate additional melee attack against the foe. The additional attack is with the same weapon and at the same attack bonus as the attack that destroyed the weapon or shield. Momentum Swing: To use this maneuver, you must charge a foe in the first round, and you must make an attack using your Power Attack feat in the second round. The penalty you take on your attack roll must be -5 or worse. Your attacks during the second round gain a bonus equal to your attack roll penalty x 1-1/2, or x 3 if you're using a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands. For instance, if you choose to take a -6 penalty on your attack roll, you can deal an extra 9 points of damage, or an extra 18 points if you're using a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands.

Elusive Target	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:6		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility																		DESC:The Elusive Target feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Negate Power Attack: To use this maneuver, you must designate a specifi c foe to be affected by your Dodge feat. If that foe uses the Power Attack feat against you, the foe gains no bonus on the damage roll but still takes the corresponding penalty on the attack roll. Diverting Defense: To use this maneuver, you must be flanked and you must designate one of the flanking attackers to be affected by your Dodge feat. The fi rst attack of the round from the designated attacker automatically misses you and may strike the other flanking foe instead; the attacking creature makes an attack roll normally, and its ally is considered fl atfooted. If the designated attacker is making a full attack against you, its second and subsequent attacks function normally. Cause Overreach: To use this maneuver, you must provoke an attack of opportunity from a foe by moving out of a threatened square. If the foe misses you, you can make a free trip attempt against this foe, and the foe does not get a chance to trip you if your attempt fails.																	SOURCEPAGE:CW		
Formation Expert	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:6																				DESC:The Formation Expert feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. You gain the benefi t of the feat even if you are fi ghting in formation with allies that do not have this feat. Lock Shields: To use this maneuver, you must have a ready shield, and adjacent allies on opposite sides of you must have ready shields. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. Step into the Breach: To use this maneuver, you must be within a single move of an ally who falls in combat, and an ally must occupy every square between you and the fallen comrade. You can immediately take a single move action (as if you had readied an action to do so) to move into the square the fallen ally occupies. Wall of Polearms: To use this maneuver, you must be wielding a shortspear, longspear, trident, glaive, guisarme, halberd, or ranseur, and you must have adjacent allies wielding weapons identical to yours on opposite sides of you. You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls.																	SOURCEPAGE:CW		
Giantbane	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:6								PRESKILL:1,Tumble=5								PRESIZELTEQ:M				DESC:The Giantbane feat enables the use of three tactical Maneuvers. Duck Underneath: To use this maneuver, you must have taken a total defense action, then have been attacked by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. You gain a +4 dodge bonus to your Armor Class, which stacks with the bonus for total defense. If that foe misses you, on your next turn, as a free action, you may make a DC 15 Tumble check. If the check succeeds, you move immediately to any unoccupied square on the opposite side of the foe (having successfully ducked underneath your foe). If there is no unoccupied square on the opposite side of the foe or you fail the Tumble check, you remain in the square you are in and have failed to duck underneath your foe. Death from Below: To use this maneuver, you must have successfully used the duck underneath maneuver. You may make an immediate single attack against the foe you ducked underneath. That foe is treated as fl at-footed, and you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll. Climb Aboard: To use this maneuver, you must move adjacent to a foe at least two size categories larger than you. In the following round, you may make a DC 10 Climb check as a free action to clamber onto the creature's back or limbs (you move into one of the squares the creature occupies). The creature you're standing on takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls against you, because it can strike at you only awkwardly. If the creature moves during its action, you move along with it. The creature can try to shake you off by making a grapple check opposed by your Climb check. If the creature succeeds, you wind up in a random adjacent square.																	SOURCEPAGE:CW		
Raptor School	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:6								PRESKILL:1,Jump=5			PRESTAT:1,WIS=13									DESC:The Raptor School feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Eagle's Swoop: To use this maneuver, you must charge a foe or jump down on your enemy from at least 10 feet up (see page 77 of the Player's Handbook). Make a Jump check as a free action immediately before your next attack. Prior to making the roll, determine the DC of the check: either DC 15 for a chance to deal 2 extra points of damage or DC 25 for a chance to deal 4 extra points of damage. If you fail this Jump check, you miss your target, and if you fail this Jump check by 5 or more, you fall prone in an adjacent square. Falcon's Feathers: To use this maneuver, you must be wearing a cloak. As a standard action, you can whip the cloak around you in a distracting fashion. Make an attempt to feint in combat (see page 68 of the Player's Handbook), using your base attack bonus instead of your Bluff modifier. If you succeed, your target is treated as fl at-footed for the next melee attack you make against it. Hawk's Eye: To use this maneuver, you must spend at least 1 full round observing your foe. While doing so, you can take no other actions. The next melee attack you make against your foe gains a +2 bonus on the attack and damage rolls for every round you have just spent observing the foe, to a maximum bonus of +6 (for 3 consecutive full rounds of observation). If the target of your observation attacks you while you're observing, or if you don't make the melee attack within 3 rounds of the end of your observation, you don't get the benefi t of the feat.

Shock Trooper	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:6		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Bull Rush,Power Attack																		DESC:The Shock Trooper feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Directed Bull Rush: To use this maneuver, you must make a successful bull rush attempt as part of a charge. For every square you push your foe back, you may also push that foe one square to the left or right. Domino Rush: To use this maneuver, you must make a successful bull rush attempt that forces a foe into the same square as another foe. You may make a free trip attempt against both foes at the same time, and neither foe gets a chance to trip you if your attempt fails. Heedless Charge: To use this maneuver, you must charge and make the attack at the end of the charge using your Power Attack feat. The penalty you take on your attack roll must be -5 or worse. In addition to normal charge modifi ers (which give you a -2 penalty to AC and a +2 bonus on the attack roll), you can assign any portion of the attack roll penalty from Power Attack to your Armor Class instead, up to a maximum equal to your base attack bonus.																	SOURCEPAGE:CW		
Sun School	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:4		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Flurry of Blows																		DESC:The Sun School feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Inexorable Progress of Dawn: To use this maneuver, you must hit the same foe with the fi rst two unarmed attacks from a flurry of blows. If you do, your foe must move back 5 feet, and you may move 5 feet forward if you wish. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity for either character. Blinding Sun of Noon: To use this maneuver, you must successfully stun the same foe with an unarmed attack two rounds in a row. In addition to being stunned, that enemy is confused for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Flash of Sunset: To use this maneuver, you must move adjacent to a foe instantaneously, as with a dimension door spell or the monk's abundant step class feature.
