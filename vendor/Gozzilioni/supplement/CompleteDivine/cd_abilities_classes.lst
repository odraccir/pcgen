Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FavoredSoulClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Favored souls are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A favored soul is also proficient with her deity's favored weapon. Although a favored soul is not proficient with heavy armor, wearing it does not interfere with her spellcasting.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FavoredSoulClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A favored soul casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to clerics), which are drawn from the cleric spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric must. To cast a spell, a favored soul must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Diffi culty Class for a saving throw against a favored soul's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the favored soul's Wisdom modifi er. Like other spellcasters, a favored soul can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1: The Favored Soul. In addition, she receives bonus spells for a high Charisma. Unlike a cleric, a favored soul's selection of spells is limited. A favored soul begins play knowing four 0-level spells and three 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new favored soul level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-2: Favored Soul Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, her Charisma score does not affect the number of spells a favored soul knows; the numbers on Table 1-2 are fi xed.) Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered favored soul level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a favored soul can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the favored soul "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level favored soul spell the favored soul can cast. A favored soul may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. Unlike a cleric, a favored soul need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShugenjaClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Shugenjas are proficient with all simple weapons and with the short sword (they often carry a masterwork short sword called a wakizashi). They are not profi cient with any type of armor, nor with shields. In their home culture, it is considered inappropriate for a shugenja to wear armor, although shugenjas serving with the military or traveling in foreign lands sometimes take the time to learn how to wear armor properly.

Sense Elements	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShugenjaClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:One of the first "spells" a shugenja learns-a magical effect so basic that it becomes a spell-like ability-is the ability to sense elements. As a full-round action, a shugenja can become aware of all sources of one chosen element (air, earth, fi re, or water) within 10 feet of him. The shugenja learns the size of the objects but not their precise location or actual nature. By concentrating longer, a shugenja can either extend her magical senses or gather more information about the elements he has detected. Each additional round spent in concentration allows the shugenja to add 5 feet to the radius of his sense ability, to a maximum of 5 additional feet per shugenja level. Thus, at 4th level, Kitsu Mari can sense elements to a maximum range of 30 feet by concentrating for five full rounds. Alternatively, the shugenja can focus on one source of the sensed element per round, attempting a Spellcraft check to determine more about that single item. The amount of information he learns depends on his Spellcraft check result. In subsequent rounds, a shugenja can retry his Spellcraft check on the same item, shift his attention to a different item, or extend the range of his senses. A 1st-level shugenja can use this ability three times per day. Every five levels he advances as a shugenja allows him to use the ability an additional time per day (four times at 5th level, five times at 10th level, and so one). Like many divination spells, a shugenja's sense elements ability is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShugenjaClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A shugenja casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to clerics and druids), which are drawn from the shugenja spell list (page XX). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below). To learn or cast a spell, a shugenja must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a shugenja's spell is 10 + the spell level + the shugenja's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a shugenja can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-3: The Shugenja. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see page 8 in the Player's Handbook). A shugenja's selection of spells is extremely limited. A shugenja begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of his choice, plus one 0-level spell and one 1st-level spell determined by his shugenja order. At each new shugenja level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1-4: Shugenja Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a shugenja knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1-4 are fixed.) One spell of every level is determined by the shugenja's order; sometimes these spells are normal spells on the shugenja spell list, but often they are additions to the spell list. These spells are listed with the shugenja spell list below. Half of the spells a shugenja knows must be of his chosen element, as indicated on Table 1-4. A shugenja may use a higher-level slot to cast a lower-level spell if he so chooses. For example, if an 8th-level shugenja has used up all his 3rd-level spell slots for the day but wants to cast another one, he could use a 4th-level slot to do so. The spell is still treated as its actual level, not the level of the slot used to cast it. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered shugenja level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a shugenja can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the shugenja "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level shugenja spell the shugenja can cast. For instance, upon reaching 4th level, a shugenja could trade in a single 0-level spell (two spell levels below the highest-level shugenja spell he can cast, which is 2nd) for a different 0-level spell. At 6th level, he could trade in a single 0-level or 1st-level spell (since he now can cast 3rdlevel shugenja spells) for a different spell of the same level. A shugenja may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. A shugenja still must honor his elemental focus. Shugenjas do not have spellbooks, though they write their spells on ofudas. These ofudas serve as divine focus items and must be read as part of the spellcasting process. Shugenjas can use the Scribe Scroll feat to create magic scrolls that work the same as a wizard or cleric's scrolls. When casting metamagic spells, remember that the shugenja has not prepared the spell in advance, and is doing so on the spot. The shugenja, therefore, must take more time to cast a metamagic spell than a regular spell. If its normal casting time is 1 standard action, casting a metamagic spell is a full-round action for a shugenja. For spells with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell. Shugenjas cannot use the Quicken Spell metamagic feat.

Element Focus	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShugenjaClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:All shugenjas have a favored element: air, earth, fire, or water. A shugenja's choice of specialized element is sometimes determined by the shugenja order in which he studies. At least half the spells a shugenja knows at each spell level must belong to his favored element, and the spell dictated by his order often belongs to that element as well. This is refl ected on Table 1-4, which indicates how many spells of each level must be spells of the shugenja's favored element. At 1st level, for example, the shugenja Kitsu Mari must know at least three 0-level water spells-one water spell determined by his order and two additional water spells, plus two other 0-level spells of any element. He also knows one 1st-level water spell from his order, one additional 1st-level water spell, and one 1st-level spell of any element. Shugenjas automatically gain the benefi ts of the Spell Focus feat (+1 to spell DCs) for spells from their favored element, regardless of its school. As the cost of specializing in one element, a shugenja is prohibited from learning spells associated with a different element. The prohibited element is dictated by the favored element, as described below. The shugenjas of the Order of the Ineffable Mystery can specialize in any of the four elements. The Ineffable Mystery also trains shugenjas who specialize the fifth element, void. (See the void disciple prestige class in Chapter 2.)

These are the weapons commonly used by the tribal societies in which spirit shamans are found.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A spirit shaman casts divine spells from the druid spell list. She can cast any spell she has retrieved, much like a bard or sorcerer can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To retrieve or cast a spell, a spirit shaman must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell level (Wisdom 10 for 0-level spells, Wisdom 11 for 1st-level spells, and so on). The Diffi culty Class for a saving throw against a spirit shaman's spell is 10 + the spell level + the spirit shaman's Charisma modifi er. Like other spellcasters, a spirit shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-5: The Spirit Shaman. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifi ers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). Like a sorcerer, a spirit shaman knows only a small number of spells. However, each day a spirit shaman may change the spells she knows. When a spirit shaman meditates to regain her daily allotment of spells (see below), she sends forth her spirit guide to bargain with the spirits and retrieve knowledge of the specifi c druid spells she will be able to use that day. She can cast any spell she has retrieved at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. For example, a 3rd-level spirit shaman can retrieve three 0-level, two 1st-level, and one 2nd-level druid spells. She can cast 0-level spells fi ve times, 1st-level spells four times, and her 2nd-level spell two times in the course of the day. She might end up using the same 0-level spell fi ve times, or one 0-level spell two times and another 0-level spell three times, or any combination that adds up to fi ve uses of any of her 0-level spells. If a spirit shaman knows any metamagic feats, she applies them to her spells when she retrieves her spells for the day. For example, a spirit shaman might choose to retrieve an empowered fl ame strike by using a 6th-level spell retrieved slot. Any time she uses fl ame strike during the ensuing day,she must use a 6th-level spell slot to cast it, and it is always empowered. A spirit shaman could use a 4th-level spell slot and a 6th-level spell slot to retrieve fl ame strike and empowered fl ame strike if she wanted to have both spells available to her in a day. A spirit shaman cannot choose to alter her spells with metamagic feats on the fl y, as other spontaneous casters do. Spirit shamans using metamagic feats do not have an increased casting time as sorcerers do. Each spirit shaman must choose atime at which she must spend 1 hour in quiet meditation to regain her daily allotment of spells and bargain with the spirits for the specifi c spells she knows on that day.

Spirit Guide	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:All spirit shamans have a spirit guide, a personification of the spirit world. In some sense a spirit shaman and her guide are one being, both knowing and seeing and experiencing the same things. Unlike a familiar, a spirit guide is not a separate entity from a spirit shaman. She is the only one who can perceive or interact with her guide. It exists only inside her own mind and soul. The spirit shaman's spirit guide confers greater awareness of her surroundings, and grants her the Alertness feat. The spirit guide grants additional abilities at 5th and 10th level (see Follow the Guide and Guide Magic, below). The exact form of the spirit guide is chosen by the spirit shaman at 1st level, usually for the qualities it represents, as shown above. The exact form of a spirit guide is purely personal preference, and confers no special advantages or disadvantages.

Wild Empathy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Guided by her insight into animal spirits, a spirit shaman can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (a monster of the animal type). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4: Skills in the Player's Handbook). The spirit shaman rolls 1d20 and adds her spirit shaman level and her Charisma modifi er to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the spirit shaman and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, infl uencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute (as with infl uencing people, use of this ability might take more or less time). A spirit shaman cannot use this ability to infl uence a magical beast.

Chastise Spirits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a spirit shaman can use divine energy granted by her patrons in the spirit world to damage hostile spirits (see the What is a Spirit? sidebar). Chastising spirits is a standard action that deals 1d6 damage/shaman level to all spirits within 30 feet of the shaman. The affected spirits get a Will save (DC 10+ shaman level + Cha modifier) for half damage. When using this ability against incorporeal creatures, a spirit shaman does not have to roll the normal 50%% miss chance-the effect hits the spirits automatically. A spirit shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

The shaman goes into a meditative state in which she travels to the spirit world. Performing the rite requires 10 minutes; the spirit shaman can only ward herself with this ability and cannot perform the rite for anyone else. The blessing functions just like protection from evil, except it protects against spirits and lasts until it is dismissed or dispelled.

Once per day, as a standard action, she can make herself incorporeal for up to 1 minute. While incorporeal, a spirit shaman gains all the advantages of the incorporeal subtype (see the Glossary of the Monster Manual), including immunity to all nonmagical attack forms, a 50%% chance to ignore damage from any corporeal source, and the ability to enter or pass through solid objects. The spirit shaman loses any armor or natural armor bonus to AC, but gains a defl ection bonus equal to her Charisma modifi er (minimum +1). She has no Strength score against corporeal creatures or objects and cannot make physical attacks against them, but she gains the ability to make a melee touch attack (add the spirit shaman's Dexterity modifi er to her attack roll) that deals 1d6 points of damage to a corporeal target. This effect is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 15th level and higher, a spirit shaman can use her spirit form twice per day. At 20th level, she can use this ability three times per day.

The spirit shaman can act normally while her spirit guide concentrates on the spell. A spirit guide can concentrate on only one spell at a time. If necessary to maintain the spell, the spirit guide makes Concentration checks for the spirit shaman, using the spirit shaman's normal Concentration modifier. A spirit guide does not have to make Concentration checks for circumstances such as the spirit shaman taking damage. The spirit itself is not present for anyone to interrupt or otherwise interact with.	KEY:Spirit Shaman ~ Guide Magic																										SORTKEY:Class_Spirit_Shaman	SOURCEPAGE:CD				
Recall Spirit	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 11th level, a spirit shaman gains the ability to call back the spirit of a dead creature before the spirit of the deceased has completely left the body. Once per week, she can reconnect a spirit to its body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The ability must be used within 1 round of the victim's death. This ability functions like raise dead, except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature is only restored to -1 hit points (but is stabilized).	KEY:Spirit Shaman ~ Recall Spirit																										SORTKEY:Class_Spirit_Shaman	SOURCEPAGE:CD				
Exorcism	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 13th level, as a full-round action, a spirit shaman can force a possessing creature or spirit out of the body it inhabits (for example, a ghost with the malevolence ability). To exorcise a possessing creature, she makes a class level check (also adding her Charisma modifi er, if any), against a DC of 10 + the possessing creature's HD + its Charisma modifier (if any).

Weaken Spirits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 16th level and higher, a spirit shaman can choose to strip spirits of their defenses instead of damaging them with her chastise spirits ability. When a spirit is weakened, it loses its spell resistance and any damage reduction overcome by magic weapons, silver or cold iron weapons, and aligned weapons (but not damage reduction overcome by adamantine weapons or not overcome by anything). In addition, an incorporeal spirit loses its immunity to nonmagical attack, its 50%% chance to ignore damage from corporeal sources, and its ability to move into or through objects. To weaken spirits, a spirit shaman uses her chastise spirits ability but chooses to do less damage in exchange for weakening the spirits for a short time. For each 3d6 of chastise spirit damage the spirit shaman foregoes, the affected spirits are weakened for 1 round. For example, a 16th-level spirit shaman chastising two dread wraiths deals 16d6 points of damage to each dread wraith, but she could choose to deal 7d6 points of damage to each wraith and weaken them for 3 rounds. Spirits that make their Will save against the chastise spirits damage are unaffected by the weakening effect (but still take half the damage).

Favored of the Spirits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpiritShamanClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 19th level, a spirit shaman learns how to perform a special rite that guards her from death. Performing the rite requires 8 hours, and the spirit shaman must bargain away part of her life force, expending 1,000 experience points. The rite's effect lasts until it is dismissed or discharged. While under the protection of this rite, a spirit shaman instantly receives the benefi t of a heal spell (caster level equal to her spirit shaman level) if she is reduced to 0 hit points or lower or has any ability score reduced to 0. The spirit shaman receives the spell's effect immediately, even if reduced to -10 hit points or lower by an enemy attack, and thus may survive a blow that otherwise would have killed her. The rite's protection is discharged once it is triggered, and the spirit shaman must perform a new rite to use this ability again.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BlighterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Since blighters are ex-druids, they lose their druid spellcasting abilities. However, they gain access to new, more destructive spells. At each blighter level, the character gains spells per day according to Table 2-3. She must choose her spells from the blighter spell list, below. The blighter's caster level is equal to her blighter level plus her druid level. To cast a blighter spell, a blighter must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blighter with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blighter bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blighter's Wisdom modifi er. When the blighter gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance 2nd-level spells for a 2nd level blighter), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The blighter's spell list appears below. A blighter has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which toprepare, just as a druid. A blighter prepares and casts spells just as a druid does (though a blighter cannot spontaneously cast summon spells). The blighter gains access to her daily spells through deforestation (see below). If she goes more than 24 hours without deforesting a wooded area, she cannot cast spells until she does so. The default divine focus for any spell cast by a blighter is a desiccated sprig of holly or mistletoe. Any material component for a blighter's spell must have been dead for at least a day before use.

Deforestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BlighterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A blighter can kill all nonsentient plant life within a radius of 20 feet per blighter level as a full-round action once per day. If a potentially affected plant is under the control of another (such as a druid's liveoak or a dryad's home tree), the controller can make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blighter level + blighter's Wis modifi er) to keep it alive. Affected plants immediately cease photosynthesis, root tapping, and all other methods of sustenance. Like picked fl owers, they appear vibrant for several hours, but within a day, they turn brown and wither. Except for plants selected by a controller, nothing can grow in a deforested area until it has a hallow spell cast upon it and it is reseeded. Deforestation enables a blighter to cast her daily allotment of spells. This ability works in any terrain, but deforesting a sandy desert, ice fl oe, or other environment with only sparse vegetation does not empower the character to cast spells.

Consecrated harriers purposely word the requirements for conducting themselves vaguely, so that an individual consecrated harrier in the fi eld has some fl exibility. Harriers who fail to act according to their code of conduct must undertake an act of atonement before they can add any further levels of this class (see the atonement spell description, page 201 of the Player's Handbook).

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ContemplativeClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A contemplative who was previously a spellcaster continues to gain access to more powerful divine magic while following the contemplative path. Thus, when a new contemplative level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in the spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, more frequent remove disease, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of contemplative to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. For example, if Theresa, an 11th-level cleric, gains a level as a contemplative, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 12th level as a cleric, but uses the other contemplative aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus. If she next gains a level as a cleric, making her a 12th-level cleric/1st-level contemplative, she gains spells as if she had risen to 13th level as a cleric. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a contemplative, the player must decide which class to assign each level of contemplative for the purpose of determining divine spells per day and spells known. If the contemplative did not previously belong to a divine spellcasting class, she gains the ability to cast divine spells exactly as a cleric of her patron deity.

Shard of Entropy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropomancerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Twice per day, for a maximum of 1 round per entropomancer level, the character can create a miniature shard of entropy. The shard is a chunk of absolute blackness, 2 inches across, and can be moved up to 30 feet by the entropomancer as a standard action. Against objects, the shard deals 3d6 points of damage, bypassing the object's hardness. Against creatures, the entropomancer must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if successful the shard deals 3d6 points of damage to the target (Fortitude half, DC 12 + the entropomancer's Wis modifier). The shard appears in any square adjacent to the entropomancer when it is created, and it can be used to attack on the round it is formed. The shard of entropy lurches, jumps, and bounces around the square it's in. Any creature who passes through the shard's square takes damage as if the shard struck him (Fortitude half), as does any creature that's in the same square as the shard at the beginning of the entropomancer's turn.  The entropomancer can move the shard into another square with a move action, or aim it at a specific creature (dealing damage immediately) as a standard action. At 5th level, the entropomancer can use the shard to create a deeper connection to absolute nothingness. The shard of entropy deals 5d6 points of damage (Fortitude half, DC 14 + entropomancer's Wis modifier). At 9th level, the shard of entropy becomes even stronger, dealing 7d6 points of damage (Fortitude half, DC 16 + entropomancer's Wis modifier). It also exerts an inexorable tug on creatures nearby, pulling them toward the shard. At the end of the entropomancer's turn, the shard tries to pull creatures within 15 feet closer to it. This is treated as a bull rush attempt, for which the shard has a +11 bonus. If the shard wins the opposed check, it bull rushes creatures in a direct line toward its square.

She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained.

Entropic Field	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropomancerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, an entropomancer can surround herself with a fi eld of invisible, entropic energy that lasts for 1 round per entropomancer level. The fi eld extends in a 5-foot per entropomancer level radius, centered on the entropomancer. All magical healing automatically fails within the entropic fi eld. It takes the entropomancer a standard action to dismiss the entropic fi eld. At 5th level, the entropic fi eld becomes strong enough to warp the laws of probability. Once per round, as a free action, the entropomancer can force a character within the fi eld (including herself) to reroll an attack, save, or check. The entropomancer demands the reroll after she knows whether the attack, save, or check succeeded or failed, but before the exact consequences have been calculated and applied. The result of the reroll takes precedence, even if it's worse than the original roll. At 7th level, the entropic fi eld causes wounds created within it to continue bleeding, dealing an additional 1 point of damage per round thereafter (at the end of the entropomancer's turn) as long as they remain within the entropic fi eld. A successful Heal check (DC 15) stops the bleeding. If multiple wounds are suffered, then the creature takes 1 point of damage per wound. The entropomancer is subject to the bleeding effect.

This ability is similar to the bard's bardic music ability (see page 29 of the Player's Handbook for a complete description) and, indeed, evangelist levels stack with bard levels to determine the strength of known bard songs. For example, a bard 3/evangelist 5 improves his inspire competence ability, but does not gain any new bard abilities. He could use bardic music to convert the unfaithful, countersong, fascinate, inspire the righteous, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, but would not gain the inspire competence, inspire greatness, or suggestion abilities.

He still acquires and prepares his spells in the normal manner for his individual spellcasting classes. When he casts them, however, he can mix or match spellcasting parameters from any of his classes to gain the maximum possible advantage for any spell with a spell level equal to or less than his spell versatility score. Thus, as a 4th-level geomancer, he can cast any of his 3rd-level or lower sorcerer/wizard spells with no chance of arcane spell failure from armor. (The druidic prohibition against metal armor still applies to druid/geomancers, however, since this stricture stems from a spiritual oath rather than a practical limitation.) The geomancer may use his Wisdom modifi er to set the save DC for arcane spells, or his Charisma or Intelligence modifi er (whichever he would normally use for arcane spells) to set the save DC for divine spells. If a spell requires either an arcane material component or a divine focus, he may use either. A cleric/geomancer who also has levels of wizard, sorcerer, or bard can spontaneously convert any prepared arcane or divine spell (except a domain spell) of an appropriate level into a cure or infl ict spell of equal or lower level, though he must be capable of casting the latter as a cleric.

Once per day, as a full-round action, a holy liberator may magically call his companion from the celestial realms in which it resides. The companion immediately appears adjacent to the holy liberator and remains for 2 hours per holy liberator level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The companion is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the holy liberator may release a particular companion from service (if it has grown too old to join her struggle, for instance). Each time the companion is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The companion also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed (including barding, saddle, and the like for mounts). Calling the companion is a conjuration (calling) Effect. Should the holy liberator's companion die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The liberator may not call another companion for thirty days or until he gains a liberator level, whichever comes fi rst, even if the companion is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the liberator takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SacredExorcistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A sacred exorcist advances in spellcasting ability as well as learning the skills of exorcism. Thus, when a new sacred exorcist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, more frequent remove disease, and so on). This means that she adds the level of sacred exorcist to the level of another spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. For example, if Delliva, an 8th-level cleric, gains a level as a sacred exorcist, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 9th level as a cleric, but uses the other sacred exorcist aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonuses. If she next gains a level as a cleric, making her a 9th-level cleric/1st-level sacred exorcist, she gains spells as if she had risen to 10th level as a cleric. If a character had more than one spellcasting class in which she could cast dismissal or dispel evil before she became a sacred exorcist, the player must decide which class to assign each level of sacred exorcist for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

If the exorcist's result equals or exceeds the DC, she succeeds in forcing the possessor from the body, with the normal results based on its method of possession.

This functions identically to the rogue's sneak attack ability (see the Rogue section in Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook). At 2nd level, the temple raider's extra damage on a successful sneak attack is +1d6, and this rises by +1d6 per three temple raider levels thereafter.

He retains his Dexterity modifier to AC (if any) even if he is caught fl at-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity modifi er to AC if immobilized.

This defense denies an enemy the ability to sneak attack the temple raider by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has temple raider levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class, the levels from the class(es) that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the temple raider.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.UrPriestClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An ur-priest gains the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast a spell, an ur-priest must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an ur-priest with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Ur-priest bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Wisdom modifier. When Table 2-23 indicates that the ur-priest gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, such as 0 2nd-level spells at 2nd level, the ur-priest gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ur-priest spell list is identical to the cleric spell list. An ur-priest has access to any spell on the list and prepares those spells as a cleric, except that he does not pray for spells, he just takes them. An ur-priest casts spells as a cleric does, except that unlike a cleric, he does not have the ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, nor does he have domain spells or associated domain granted powers. He does not have restrictions on spells with alignments. To determine the caster level of an ur-priest, add the character's ur-priest levels to one-half of his levels in other spellcasting classes.

Siphon Spell Power	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.UrPriestClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Because they steal whatever power they can, ur-priests learn to manipulate their energy in ways that confound other casters. An ur-priest of 6th level or higher can temporarily sacrifi ce two (or more) lower-level spell slots and use those slots to  prepare a higher-level spell. The higher-level spell must be of a level the ur-priest can cast. Only one exchange of this sort can be made each day. The levels of the lower-level slots are totaled, then reduced to three-quarters (round down) to determine the level of the extra higher-level spell slot. For example, an ur-priest who sacrifi ces a 3rd-level spell and a 5th-level spell can use that spell slot to prepare an additional 6th-level spell (3 + 5 = 8, and 8 x 3/4 = 6).	KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Siphon Spell Power																										SORTKEY:Class_Ur_Priest	SOURCEPAGE:CD				
Steal Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.UrPriestClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The most powerful ur-priests can use the same techniques that siphon off the gods' spell power to steal the spell-like abilities of another creature. Once each day, when a creature with spell-like abilities is within 50 feet of a 10thlevel ur-priest, the ur-priest can choose one of the spell-like abilities of the creature to steal for himself. The ur-priest can use the spell-like ability as often as the creature can, or three times per day, whichever is less. The ur-priest uses the ability as the creature does with regard to caster level and save DCs. This ability only lasts 24 hours. The creature with the spell-like ability does not lose the ability when the urpriest steals it. If an ur-priest tries to steal a spell-like ability that the creature doesn't have, or tries to steal an ability that is supernatural rather than spell-like, the attempt automatically fails. For example, if an ur-priest is near a noble salamander, he can steal fireball and use it three times that day or steal dispel magic and use it once that day. If he is near a pit fi end, he could steal teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only) and use it three times per day, because the pit fi end can do it at will. He could even steal the pit fi end's wish ability, but because a pit fi end can only use wish once per year, the ur-priest would be similarly limited. He could not steal that power again from any creature for one year.	KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Steal Spell-Like Ability																										SORTKEY:Class_Ur_Priest	SOURCEPAGE:CD

She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the character had more than one spellcasting class in which she could cast 3rd-level spells before becoming a void disciple, the player must decide to which class to add each void disciple level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Sense Void	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VoidDiscipleClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The first technique taught to the void disciple is the ability to reach out with the mind and sense the world around, exploring the unseen layer of reality most people rarely experience. The void disciple's consciousness actually departs her body and extends into the world, allowing her to use her normal senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell) to perceive whatever area, person, or thing she directs her attention to. The void disciple must make a Spellcraft check, with the DC determined by distance, not familiarity. A void disciple cannot sense across planar boundaries. Thus, a void disciple standing on one side of a gate could not extend her senses through it. With every four levels a void disciple attains beyond 1st, she gains the ability to perceive deeper levels of reality. At 5th level, a void disciple can use detect magic and detect evil at will. At 9th level, she can use discern lies and read emotional states, gaining a +10 bonus on Sense Motive checks. At 13th level, she can detect thoughts at will. A void disciple can use this ability once per day at 1st level.

The void disciple must use a standard action to touch the target. The target gains either one feat or a number of ranks in one skill equal to his relevant ability modifier for that skill. For example, a character with Dexterity 14 could gain 2 ranks in Ride, for a total skill modifier of +4. The effect lasts for 1 round per level of the void disciple.

The void disciple gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level she bestows. If the target has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature a -1 competence penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his highest available level. Negative levels stack. Assuming the target survives, he regains lost levels after 13 hours pass. This ability relies on the void disciple's mastery of void, not negative energy, so it cannot be used to benefit undead.

When he next gains a level as a warpriest, making him an 8th-level cleric/3rd-level warpriest, his number of divine spells per day does not change; but when he improves his warpriest level to 4th, he gains divine spells per day as if he had risen to 10th level as a cleric.
