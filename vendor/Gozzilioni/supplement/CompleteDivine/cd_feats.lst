Arcane Disciple	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (Religion)=4,Spellcraft=4	PRESPELLCAST:TYPE=Arcane							PREDEITY:1,Y				DESC:Add the chosen domain's spells to your class list of arcane spells. If you have arcane spellcasting ability from more than one class, you must pick which arcane spellcasting ability this feat applies to. Once chosen, this decision cannot be changed for that feat. You may learn these spells as normal for your class; however, you use Wisdom (rather than the normal ability for your spellcasting) when determining the save DC for the spell. In addition, you must have a Wisdom score equal to 10 + the spell's level in order to prepare or cast a spell gained from this feat. Each day, you may prepare (or cast, if you cast spells without preparation) a maximum of one of these domains spells of each level.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE														SOURCEPAGE:CD	BONUS:DOMAIN|NUMBER|1
Augment Healing	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Heal=4												DESC:Add +2 points per spell level to the amount of damage healed by any Conjuration [Healing] spell that you cast. For example, a 1st-level cleric with this feat casting cure light wounds would restore 1d8+3 hp. An 8th-level cleric with the Healing domain and this feat casting cure moderate wounds would restore 2d8+13 hp (9 for his caster level including the +1 caster level bonus for the Healing domain, + 4 for the feat). A 13th-level druid casting heal would restore 144 hp (130 for her caster level + 14 for the feat, since heal is a 7th-level druid spell).																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Boar's Ferocity	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape																		DESC:If your hit points are reduced to 0 or less (but you aren't killed), you can spend one wild shape as a free action (even if it isn't your turn) to continue acting as if not disabled or dying. The effect lasts for one minute.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Cheetah's Speed	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape																		DESC:You can spend one wild shape to change your base land speed to 50 feet. You may also sprint as a cheetah: Once per hour you may move 10 times your normal speed as part of a charge. This effect lasts for one hour.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Consecrate Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES																		PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:A spell you modify with this feat gains the good descriptor. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage (rounded down) results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to be reduced by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. For example, a consecrated fire storm spell cast by a 16th-level cleric deals 16d6 points of damage, half of which is fi re damage and half of which is sheer divine power. Thus, creatures immune to fi re still take damage. The consecrated spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level							ADDSPELLLEVEL:1										SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Corrupt Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES																		PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE				DESC:This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage (rounded down) results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to be reduced by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. The corrupted spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.							ADDSPELLLEVEL:1										SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Disciple of the Sun	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead,TYPE=RebukeUndead																		DESC:You may spend two turn undead attempts when you turn undead instead of one. If you do then you get destroy the undead instead of turning them.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Divine Metamagic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead,TYPE=RebukeUndead																		DESC:When you take this feat, choose a metamagic feat. This feat applies only to that metamagic feat. As a free action, you can take the energy from turning or rebuking undead and use it to apply a metamagic feat to spells that you know. You must spend one turn or rebuke attempt, plus an additional attempt for each level increase in the metamagic feat you're using. For example, Jozan the cleric could sacrifi ce three turn attempts to empower a holy smite he's casting. Because you're using positive or negative energy to augment your spells, the spell slot for the spell doesn't change.

Divine Spell Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead,TYPE=RebukeUndead														PRETEXT:Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.				DESC:You can spend a turn or rebuke attempt as a free action and roll a turning check (with a special +3 bonus, plus any other modifi ers you'd normally apply to your turning check). Treat the result of the turning check as a modifier to your caster level on the next divine spell you cast in that Round. For example, if a cleric used this feat and rolled a 16 on his turning check, he would add a +2 bonus to his caster level for the next divine spell he casts in the round. Had he rolled an 8, he would instead apply a -1 penalty to his caster level for the next divine spell he cast in the round. If you don't cast a divine spell before your next turn, you lose the effect of the check result. This feat has no effect on your arcane spellcasting ability.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Domain Focus	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You can cast spells associated with one of your domains at +1 caster level. This benefi t also applies to caster level checks to overcome a target's spell resistance as well as other variables such as spell duration. If you cast a spell from one of your nondomain spell slots, this feat does not help you, even if the spell also happens to appear on your domain list.

Domain Spontaneity	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead,TYPE=RebukeUndead																		DESC:Each time you take this feat, choose a domain that you have access to. You may now convert prepared divine spells into any spell from that domain. You expend a spell of equal or higher level, as well as expending one of your daily turn undead attempts. This works just as good clerics spontaneously cast prepared spells as cure spells.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:DOMAIN|PC														SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Eagle's Wings	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape																		DESC:You can spend one wild shape to grow feathery wings.

Elemental Healing	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=RebukeAir,TYPE=RebukeFire,TYPE=RebukeEarth,TYPE=RebukeWater																		DESC:You can spend a rebuke attempt as a standard action to send a burst of healing energy in a 60-foot burst. This affects all creatures with an elemental subtype that you could normally rebuke; such creatures are healed of 1d8 points of damage per two cleric levels. For example, a cleric with the Fire domain could use this feat to heal a fi re elemental or any other creature with the fi re subtype (since he would normally rebuke creatures with the fi re subtype with his domain power).																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Elemental Smiting	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=RebukeAir,TYPE=RebukeFire,TYPE=RebukeEarth,TYPE=RebukeWater																		DESC:Once per round, you can spend a turn attempt as a free action when making a melee attack. If you successfully strike a creature that you could turn with that turn attempt because of its elemental subtype, you may add a bonus on your damage roll equal to your cleric level. If your attack misses, the turn attempt is lost to no effect. For example, a cleric with the Fire domain could use this feat to smite a water elemental or any other creature with the water subtype (since he would normally turn creatures with the water subtype with his domain power).																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Elephant's Hide	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape															PREVARGTEQ:WildShapeProgression,2			DESC:You can spend one wild shape to give yourself a natural armor bonus of 7. This does not stack with any natural armor you currently have. The effect lasts for 10 minutes.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Empower Turning	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead,TYPE=RebukeUndead																		DESC:You can turn or rebuke more undead than usual.

If you are able to use wild shape to become an elemental, you also gain one additional elemental wild shape use per day.

Fast Wild Shape	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape									PRESTAT:1,DEX=13									DESC:You gain the ability to use wild shape as a move equivalent action.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Glorious Weapon	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead,TYPE=RebukeUndead																		DESC:You can spend a turn or rebuke attempt as standard action to align the melee weapons (including natural weapons) of all allies within a 60-ft. burst as good (if you channel positive energy) or evil (if you channel negative energy). Such weapons can overcome damage reduction as if they had the appropriate alignment. The effect lasts until the end of your next turn.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Grizzly's Claw	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape																		DESC:You can spend one wild shape to gain two primary claw attacks (both at your base attack bonus and adding your Strength bonus). The claws deal piercing and slashing damage equal to a short sword appropriate to your size (1d6 for Medium, or 1d4 for Small). The claws remain for 1 hour.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Improved Smiting	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=Smite									PRESTAT:1,CHA=13									DESC:Whenever you make a smite attack, your attack overcomes damage reduction as if had an alignment, and you deal an extra +1d6 points of damage to targets of a specific alignment. If the smite attack has an alignment associated with it, it deals its extra damage to foes of that alignment and it is treated as having the opposite alignment for overcoming damage reduction. For example, a paladin's smite evil attacks are treated as having the good alignment and deal +1d6 damage to evil targets, while a blackguard's smite good attacks are treated as having the evil alignment and deal +1d6 damage to good targets. If the smite attack has no alignment associated with it, you must choose an alignment component (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you select the feat. Your smite attacks overcome damage reduction as if they had that alignment, and deal +1d6 points of damage to foes of the opposite alignment. For example, a lawful neutral cleric of St. Cuthbert with the Destruction domain who selected this feat must choose for his smite attacks to be lawfully aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets). A lawful evil cleric of Hextor with the Destruction domain could choose to have his smite attacks be lawfully or evilly aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets or to good targets, respectively). You can't choose an alignment component that isn't part of your alignment, and once this choice is made, it can never be changed. If you later change alignment so that the chosen alignment component is no longer part of your alignment, you lose the benefits of this feat.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Lion's Punch	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape																		DESC:When you charge, you may spend a wild shape as a free action to make a full attack at the end of the charge.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Oaken Resilience	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape															PREVARGTEQ:WildShapeProgression,4			DESC:You can spend a wild shape to gain immunity to critical hits, poison, sleep, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning. You also gain great stability, which gives you a +8 bonus on checks to avoid being bull rushed or tripped. The effect remains for 10 minutes.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Practiced Spellcaster	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=4												DESC:Your caster level for the chosen spellcasting class increases by +4. This can't increase your caster level beyond your HD. However, even if you can't benefi t from the full bonus immediately, if you later gain noncaster-level HD you may be able to apply the rest of the bonus. For example, a human 5th-level cleric/3rd-level fi ghter who selects this feat would increase his cleric caster level from 5th to 8th (since he has 8 HD). If he later gained a fi ghter level, he would gain the remainder of the bonus and his cleric caster level would become 9th (since he now has 9 HD). A character with two or more spellcasting classes (such as a bard/sorcerer or a ranger/druid) must choose which class gains the feat's effect. This does not affect your spells per day or spells known. It only increases your caster level, which would help you penetrate SR and increase the duration and other effects of your spells.

Quicken Turning	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead,TYPE=RebukeUndead																		DESC:You can turn or rebuke undead as a free action. You may still make only one turning attempt per round.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Rapid Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:Only spells with a casting time greater than 1 standard action can be made rapid. A rapid spell with a casting time of 1 full round can be cast as a standard action. A rapid spell with a casting time measured in rounds can be cast in 1 full round. Rapid spells with casting times measured in minutes can be cast in 1 minute, and rapid spells with casting times measured in hours can be cast in 1 hour. A rapid spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.							ADDSPELLLEVEL:1										SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Reach Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You may cast a spell that normally has a range of touch at any distance up to 30 feet. The spell effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed on a ranged touch attack to bestow the spell upon the recipient. A reach spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD

Sanctify Relic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=ItemCreation																		DESC:Relics are magic items-often but not always wondrous items-that rely on a divine connection to a specific deity to function. They are described further in Chapter 4.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD	
Serpent's Venom	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape																		DESC:You can spend a usage of wild shape to gain a secondary bite attack (at your base attack bonus -5 and adding 1/2 your Strength bonus) that deals bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage equal to a dagger appropriate to your size (1d4 for Medium, or 1d3 for Small).

Positive Energy Aura	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	VISIBLE:YES			PREVARGTEQ:EpicCharacter,1	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=TurnUndead									PRESTAT:1,CHA=25					PRESPELL:1,Dispel Evil				DESC:Every undead creature that comes within 15 feet of you is automatically affected as if you had turned it. This doesn't cost a turning attempt, and you don't have to roll turning damage (it automatically affects all undead in a 15-foot burst), but it only turns undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than your effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically destroys undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than your effective cleric level minus 20). For example, a 22nd-level cleric would automatically turn any nearby wights or wraiths and would automatically destroy any Medium skeletons or zombies that came near him, but would have to turn nightshades and the like normally. Just as with normal turning, you can't affect undead that have total cover relative to you.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD

You animate a total number of HD of undead equal to the number of undead that would be commanded by your result (though you can't animate more undead than there are available corpses within range). You can't animate more undead with any single attempt than the maximum number you can command (including any undead already under your command). These undead are automatically under your command, though your normal limit of commanded undead still applies. If the corpses are relatively fresh, the animated undead are zombies. Otherwise, they are skeletons.																	SOURCEPAGE:CD
