Altitude Adaptation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=2				DESC:You gain a +4 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws to avoid the effects of altitude. Additionally, when you determine what effect the altitude has on you, you apply the effect for the next lower category of altitude than the category you are actually in. After you spend a week at a specific altitude, you become acclimated to that altitude and all lower altitudes, and no longer have to make Fortitude saving throws for each 6-hour period to avoid altitude sickness. If you travel to a lower altitude and remain there for a week, you lose your acclimation to the higher altitude and must reacclimatize, although you always retain the other benefits granted by this feat. Special: This feat grants a +2 bonus on all Survival checks made in high altitude (above 5,000 feet) areas.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Arctic Priest	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREDOMAIN:1,Cold,Winter				DESC:You can channel stored spell energy into spells that aid in exploring and surviving in the frostfell, even if you did not prepare these spells ahead of time. You can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any of the spells that appear on the list below, as long as the spell to be cast is of an equal or lower level to the one you lose. Spells you can spontaneously cast when using this feat include: control weather, create food and water, endure elements, heroes' feast, hibernate, protection from energy, and resist energy.

Beacon the Frozen	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Augment Summoning,Spell Focus (Conjuration)																	DEFINE:BeackonTheFrozen|0	DESC:When you summon a creature or creatures using any summon spell, you can opt to summon a version of the creature from an extraplanar frostfell. If you do so, the summoned creature gains the cold subtype, and its natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. Creatures with the fire subtype can never be enhanced with the cold subtype in this manner.															BONUS:VAR|BeackonTheFrozen|1		SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Chosen of Iborighu	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREDEITY:1,Iborighu				DESC:Cleric is favored class, cold damage gaze attack 1/day.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro	TEMPLATE:Chosen of Iborighu ~ Favored Class			
Cold Endurance	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=2				DESC:You can exist comfortably in conditions between 0° F and 90° F without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in Cold Dangers, page 8). You also gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against cold effects. Cold Endurance doesn't provide any level of resistance to cold damage.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Cold Focus	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against spells you cast with the cold descriptor. This bonus stacks with similar bonuses, such as those granted by Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus.										BONUS:DC|DESCRIPTOR.Cold|1|TYPE=ColdFocus							SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Cold Spell Specialization	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Snowcasting,Frozen Magic									PRESTAT:1,CON=13					PREMULT:1,[PREPROFWITHARMOR:1,TYPE.Light],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Armor Proficiency (Light)]				DESC:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40° F), you gain a +1 bonus per die to any dice rolled to determine damage caused by cold spells you cast. For example, if an 11th-level wizard with this feat casts a cone of cold in a cold area, the spell does 11d6+11 points of damage. In areas of extreme cold (below-20° F), the damage bonus increases to +2 per die.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Craft Skull Talisman	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=6																			DESC:You can create a skull talisman of any spell you know and that targets one or more creatures. Crafting a skull talisman takes one day. When you create a skull talisman, you set the caster level. The caster level must be suffi cient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a skull talisman is its spell level x its caster level x 100 gp. To craft the talisman, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (mostly comprised of the rare metallic inks needed to inscribe the runes of power on the skull) costing one-half this base price.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Faith in the Frost	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																	PREDOMAIN:1,Cold,Winter	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Turn Undead,Rebuke Undead				DESC:When you successfully turn or rebuke a creature, it takes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifi er as blasts of ice and cold energy tear through its body.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Frostfell Prodigy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Snowcasting,Frozen Magic,Cold Focus									PRESTAT:1,CON=13									DESC:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40° F), the ability score used to determine how many bonus spells you may prepare or cast is treated as if it were 2 higher than its actual score. If you enter an area with a warmer temperature and remain in this area for longer than 1 minute, the bonus spells granted by this feat are lost until you can regain them. In areas of extreme cold (below -20° F), the ability score is treated as if it were 4 higher than its actual score for purposes of determining how many bonus spells you can prepare or cast.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Frozen Berserker	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage				DESC:As long as you are under the effects of a barbarian rage, you gain the cold subtype. You gain immunity to cold, but have vulnerability to fire, which means you take half again as much (+50%%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Frozen Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Snowcasting									PRESTAT:1,CON=13									DESC:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40° F), spells with the cold descriptor cast by you manifest at caster Level +1. In areas of extreme cold (below -20° F), cold spells cast by you manifest at caster level +2.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Frozen Wildshape	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																	PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=6	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape				DESC:You may use your wild shape ability to assume the form of any magical beast with the cold subtype. Your new form must still fall within the size limitations of your wild shape ability. As with the standard wild shape ability, you do not gain any of the extraordinary special qualities or any supernatural abilities possessed by the new form, with the exception of the cold subtype. This subtype grants you immunity to cold but vulnerability to fire, which means you take half again as much (+50%%) damage as normal from fire while in a frozen wild shape, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure. Possible cold magical beasts from the Monster Manual include cryohydras (Huge wild shape required), frost worms (Huge wild shape required), and winter wolves. Possible cold magical beasts from Monster Manual II include frost salamanders. Possible cold magical beasts from this book include brantas (Large wild shape required), ice toads (Large wild shape required), urskans (Large wild shape required), and tlalusks (Huge wild shape required).																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Greater Cold Focus	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cold Focus																		DESC:Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against spells with the cold descriptor. This bonus stacks with similar bonuses, such as those from Cold Focus, Spell Focus, and Greater Spell Focus.										BONUS:DC|DESCRIPTOR.Cold|2|TYPE=ColdFocus							SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Icy Calling	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Snowcasting									PRESTAT:1,CON=13								DEFINE:IcyCalling|0	DESC:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40° F), creatures native to cold environments and creatures with the cold subtype summoned by you are more powerful and agile than normal. The summoned creatures gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity for the duration of the spell that summoned them. In areas of extreme cold (below -20° F), any summoned creature affected by this feat has maximum hit points when summoned.

Ice Harmonics	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Perform (Sing)=6								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bardic Music				DESC:By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you can cause any unattended nonmagical ice object or portion of ice to explode violently. The target must be within 30 feet, and you must be able to sing in order to shatter the ice. Any creature located in the 5-foot square in which you target with this ability takes piercing damage equal to 2d6 + your Charisma modifi er. Creatures made of ice that you specifi - cally target with this effect take double damage.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Improved Cold Endurance	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cold Endurance														PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=6			DEFINE:ImprovedColdEndurance|0	DESC:You gain resistance to cold 5.

Improved Frosty Touch	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PRERACE:1,Uldras				DESC:Your frosty touch ability now deals 2 points of cold damage.														BONUS:VAR|FrostyTouchDamage|1			SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Mark of Hleid	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREDEITY:1,Hleid				DESC:The actual birthmark itself radiates faint abjuration magic if it is viewed with a detect magic spell, and faint good if viewed with a detect good spell. You are immune to the frost touch special attack of a rimefire eidolon. Additionally, you can handle rimefi re ice barehanded without taking any cold damage. Cleric is now a favored class for you; the cleric class does not count when determining whether you take an experience point penalty for multiclassing. You gain a +2 sacred bonus to your Armor Class against evil-aligned creatures with the cold subtype.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro	TEMPLATE:Mark of Hleid ~ Favored Class			
Mountaineer	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You get a +2 bonus on all Climb and Survival checks.													BONUS:SKILL|Climb,Survival|2				SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Piercing Cold	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You can only apply this metamagic feat to spells with the cold descriptor. Piercing cold spells are so horribly cold that they are capable of damaging creatures normally unharmed by or resistant to cold. Piercing cold spells completely ignore any resistance to cold a creature possesses, bypassing this resistance and dealing damage to the target as if it did not possess any resistance to cold at all. They are still entitled to whatever other defenses the attack allows (such as saving throws and spell resistance). Creatures normally immune to cold can be damaged by piercing cold spells as well. Piercing cold spells deal half damage to these creatures (or one-quarter on a successful saving throw). For example, Mialee casts a piercing cold cone of cold at a night hag, a creature normally immune to cold. She makes her level check to penetrate the night hag's spell resistance, but the night hag makes her Refl ex save against the spell. Mialee rolls the dice, and her cone of cold deals 42 points of cold damage; since the night hag made her save, the damage is halved to 21 points. This damage is then halved again (since the night hag is normally immune to cold), and 10 points of cold damage are actually dealt to the night hag, who is both shocked and enraged at this unexpected turn of events. Creatures with the cold subtype can tell that a piercing cold spell is colder than normal, but they remain undamaged by the attack. Creatures with the fire subtype who are damaged by a piercing cold spell take double normal damage instead of the usual +50%%. A piercing cold spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.							ADDSPELLLEVEL:1										SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Primeval Wild Shape	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape				DESC:When you assume a wild shape form, you can opt to cause the shape assumed to be a primeval form of the creature that existed in the ancient past during a vast ice age. Doing so grants the new form a +2 racial bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to its natural armor, and resistance to cold 10. A primeval wild shape has a much shorter duration than normal, since the enhanced qualities of the new shape drain your supernatural energies much more quickly. A primeval wild shape has a duration of 1 round per druid level (or per level of the class that granted you the wild shape ability) instead of the normal 1 hour per druid level.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Primitive Caster	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:This feat only functions when you cast a spell that does not already have a verbal, somatic, or material component. For each component you voluntarily add, you increase the effective caster level of the spell by +1. You can only add a component that's not already present in the spell. For example, you can't add a somatic component to a gaseous form spell, because it already has one. You could add a verbal component, however. The verbal component you add consists of animalistic shouts, screams, and growls. The DC of Listen checks to hear you cast a spell is -5 (before modifying for distance). The somatic component is also more complex, so you must have two hands free to add a somatic component with this feat. The extra material component you add with this feat must be a rare plant found in the frostfell, which requires a successful DC 15 Profession (herbalist) check to locate.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Sea Legs	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:As long as you are on board a ship, you get a +2 bonus on all Balance and Tumble checks, and a +1 bonus on Initiative checks.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Smite Fiery Foe	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:Once per day, you may attempt to smite a creature with the fire subtype with a normal melee attack. When you activate this ability, your attack becomes infused with cold energy. You add your Charisma modifi er to your attack roll and deal 1 extra point of cold damage per character level. If you smite a creature that does not have the fire subtype, the blast of cold does not manifest and the smite attempt is used up for that day. Remember that creatures with the fire subtype take half again as much (+50%%) damage as normal from cold, including the additional damage dealt by this ability. You may swap out any daily uses of a smite ability gained by a character class or cleric domain to smite fiery foes instead.

Snowcasting	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,CON=13									DESC:If you add a handful of snow or ice as an additional material component to a spell when you cast it, the spell gains the cold descriptor. This does not actually change the nature of the spell you cast; a fireball cast with this feat still deals fire damage, but since it also carries the cold descriptor, it can be augmented by a number of feats listed in this chapter, such as Cold Focus and Frozen Magic. If you add a handful of snow or ice as an additional material component to a spell when you cast it and that spell already has the cold descriptor, you increase the effective level of the spell being cast by +1. Adding this additional material component requires you to spend a move action immediately before the spell is cast to gather fresh snow or ice from the surrounding environment. This snow or ice can be magically created by a conjuration spell, but no other ice manifested by a spell will do. You may take no other action between gathering the snow or ice and casting the spell.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Snowrunner	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Woodland Stride				DESC:You can move through loose snow at full speed, as if you were moving across open terrain. You are also skilled at moving across open ice, and gain a +5 competence bonus on Balance checks to avoid slipping when you move across icy surfaces.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Snowflake Wardance	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES										PRESKILL:1,Perform (Dance)=6								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bardic Music				DESC:By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you may perform a deadly style of combat known as the snowflake wardance. Activating a snowflake wardance is a free action, and once activated, you add your Charisma modifi er to your attack rolls with any slashing melee weapon you wield in one hand. This bonus to hit stacks with any bonuses you get from a high Strength score (or Dexterity score, if you are using Weapon Finesse). You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a shield, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load. A snowflake wardance lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Perform (dance). Performing a snowfl ake wardance is physically tiresome—when the snowflake wardance ends, you become fatigued for the next 10 minutes.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Storm Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:All spells you cast while you are affected by a storm (either natural or magical) manifest at +1 caster level. For more information on storms, see page 94 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Sugliin Mastery	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:5																PREWEAPONPROF:1,Sugliin				DESC:You can attack with a sugliin as if it were a normal weapon, either making a single attack as a standard action or a full attack as a full-round action.																	SOURCEPAGE:Fro				
Winter's Champion	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,Paladin=1																			DESC:When you gain this feat, you may add the 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-level spells granted by the Cold and Winter domains as paladin spells of the same levels. You do not gain the ability to cast spells of these domains of 5th level or higher, nor do you gain the granted powers of the domains.

Winter's Mount	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Special Mount			DEFINE:WinterSMount|0	DESC:Your special mount gains the cold subtype. It gains immunity to cold, but has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure. Your special mount is also hardier than a nonfrostfell version; it gains a +2 racial bonus to Constitution.														BONUS:VAR|WinterSMount|1			SOURCEPAGE:Fro
