Elemental Pool	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ElementalWeirdSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Weirds are physically tied to magic pools or patches of their native substance, and cannot leave except to return to their native plane, either the Elemental Plane of Air or Water. Each elemental pool has a portal to the elemental planes at its bottom. An elemental pool is always at least 40 feet in diameter and 20 feet deep, although a pool can be up to ten times that size. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its ice pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental pool. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special properties.	KEY:Elemental Weird ~ Elemental Pool																											SOURCEPAGE:Fro
