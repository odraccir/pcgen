Resolve the toss as a bull rush maneuver (+20 check modifier), except that there is no attack of opportunity, since the woolly mammoth has already grabbed its foe when it tries to toss the victim. The woolly mammoth does not need to move with its foe in order to throw its foe more than 5 feet.

Training a woolly mammoth must begin with a young animal; adults rarely cooperate and will starve themselves rather than submit to training. Training a young woolly mammoth requires six weeks and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a woolly mammoth requires an exotic saddle or howdah, which includes a prod that the animal can feel through its fur and its thick hide. A woolly mammoth can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack except with a lance or a missile weapon.

Curse	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DwarfMidgardRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per year as a standard action, a Midgard dwarf can lay a powerful curse on someone who has wronged him (usually by stealing from him, injuring him, or killing a close relation). This functions like bestow curse (DC %1, CL 20th), except that the range is unlimited, and the spell is dismissible. The save DC is Wisdom-based. The dwarf must be able to see or describe his target (for example, the thief who took my gold, wherever he is or the one who killed Snorri) and the target must be guilty of the injury the dwarf specifi es. Dwarves on the brink of falling in battle have been known to forego an attack in order to curse the enemy who is about to defeat them. A dwarf can sometimes be persuaded to lift his curse with an offer of weregildmoney to compensate the dwarf for the injury or wrong he suffered. Generally, this requires at least 1,000 gold pieces.

A Midgard dwarf can shift between its humanoid and animal form as a standard action.

Immure	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EntombedRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, an entombed that begins its turn with a hold on its opponent can attempt to drag a grappled creature under the ice, trapping it in a layer of ice and eventually creating another one of its own kind. The entombed must win an opposed grapple check; if it succeeds, it can move up to half its speed, dragging its grappled foe with it. If it has pinned its foe, the entombed gets a +4 bonus on this check. If the entombed successfully drags its foe into solid ice, the victim is immediately immobilized and cannot move or take any actions other than purely mental ones. He may be subject to drowning (although he can hold his breath before he enters the ice). As a full-round action, an entombed victim within 5 feet of the ices surface can attempt a DC %1 Strength check to break out. If he is more than 5 feet deep in the ice, a successful check does not free him, but gives him enough space to take physical actions that he could otherwise take while grappled, such as attempting to draw a light weapon, cast a spell, or attack the ice with a light weapon and try to carve his way out. An entombed often chooses to continue attacking a victim immured in the ice, since the ice does not prevent its own movement or attacks.|ImmureDC	KEY:Entombed ~ Immure				DEFINE:ImmureDC					BONUS:VAR|ImmureDC|DefaultDCStr	BONUS:VAR|ImmureDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Immure)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Immure									SOURCEPAGE:Fro

An entombed often fi ghts from the cover of an ice sheet or snow field in much the same way that an incorporeal creature can use a wall or fl oor for cover.
