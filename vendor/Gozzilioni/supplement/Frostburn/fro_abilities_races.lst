The dwarf must be able to see or describe his target (for example, "the thief who took my gold, wherever he is" or "the one who killed Snorri") and the target must be guilty of the injury the dwarf specifi es. Dwarves on the brink of falling in battle have been known to forego an attack in order to curse the enemy who is about to defeat them.

Immure	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EntombedRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, an entombed that begins its turn with a hold on its opponent can attempt to drag a grappled creature under the ice, trapping it in a layer of ice and eventually creating another one of its own kind. The entombed must win an opposed grapple check; if it succeeds, it can move up to half its speed, dragging its grappled foe with it.

If the entombed successfully drags its foe into solid ice, the victim is immediately immobilized and cannot move or take any actions other than purely mental ones.

As a full-round action, an entombed victim within 5 feet of the ice's surface can attempt a DC %1 Strength check to break out. If he is more than 5 feet deep in the ice, a successful check does not free him, but gives him enough space to take physical actions that he could otherwise take while grappled, such as attempting to draw a light weapon, cast a spell, or attack the ice with a light weapon and try to carve his way out.

Beguiling Song	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RusalkaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A rusalka can attempt to beguile creatures with her song. The rusalka sings, targeting a single creature it can see within 300 feet of her body of water (see Water Symbiosis, below). This is a sonic, mind-affecting ability, and the creature must be able to hear the rusalka for it to take effect. The targeted creature must make a DC %1 Will saving throw. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by that rusalka's song for 24 hours. Failure indicates the creature is utterly beguiled and moves toward the rusalka, taking the most direct route available. If that path leads into a dangerous area (such as very deep or fast-moving water), the beguiled creature is entitled to a second saving throw. A rusalka who desires a companion often moves out of the water and bestows water breathing on its beguiled victim so that she can take him underwater. A beguiled creature may take no actions other than defending himself. A beguiled victim who moves within 5 feet of the rusalka must make a DC 18 Will saving throw or be charmed as per charm monster cast by an 8th-level sorcerer. Success means that the character is freed from the beguilement and is immune to that rusalka's beguiling song for 24 hours. The beguiling effect continues as long as the rusalka sings. A rusalka need not continue to sing to keep a victim Charmed. A rusalka can use her beguiling song both above and below the water. Good rusalkas cast water breathing on their charmed companions to keep them alive below the waves. Evil rusalkas move into deep water, forcing a beguiled victim to move toward them but never allowing the victim to get within 5 feet. If these unlucky creatures fail their second saving throw, they usually drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).|BeguilingSongDC	KEY:Rusalka ~ Beguiling Song				DEFINE:BeguilingSongDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BeguilingSongDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|BeguilingSongDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Beguiling Song)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Beguiling Song									SOURCEPAGE:Fro

Training	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TlaluskRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Although intelligent, a tlalusk requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a tlalusk must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer. This can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check, but tlalusks are usually hostile toward almost any would-be trainer other than a frost giant, toward whom they are normally unfriendly. Training a friendly tlalusk requires six weeks of work and a DC 30 Handle Animal check. Riding a trained tlalusk requires an exotic saddle. Up to four Medium or smaller creatures can ride on a tlalusk comfortably, although this requires an exotic saddle that costs four times the normal amount, and only one of the riders can attempt to control the tlalusk with Ride checks each round. A tlalusk can fi ght while carrying riders, but the riders cannot also attack unless they succeed on Ride checks Young tlalusks are worth 10,000 gp on the open market, although most cities that know anything about the beasts have made traffi cking in tlalusks illegal within city walls because of the destruction even a young one can wreak.

Fish cloud	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VodyanoiRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When submerged in water, a vodyanoi can summon a huge school of magic fi sh to provide concealment (similar to the fog cloud spell). This school of fi sh swims around the point the vodyanoi designates in a 20-foot radius. This cloud of fi sh obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (20%% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50%% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). A strong current disperses the cloud of fi sh in 4 rounds. A very strong current disperses the fi sh in 1 round. The fish created by this spell are formed of magic; they are not real animals, and objects and energies pass through them as though they were not there. A vodyanoi can summon a fi sh cloud three times per day. The fi sh cloud remains for 40 minutes or until dispersed or dispelled. Vodyanoi sometimes use this ability to deceive villagers, making them think the vodyanoi have brought fi sh to their waters.
