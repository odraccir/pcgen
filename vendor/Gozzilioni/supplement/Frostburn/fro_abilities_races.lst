Training	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WollyMammothRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Giants and humanoids such as frost folk, humans, and ogres sometimes use woolly mammoths as mounts or pack animals. Training a woolly mammoth must begin with a young animal; adults rarely cooperate and will starve themselves rather than submit to training. Training a young woolly mammoth requires six weeks and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a woolly mammoth requires an exotic saddle or howdah, which includes a prod that the animal can feel through its fur and its thick hide. A woolly mammoth can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack except with a lance or a missile weapon.
