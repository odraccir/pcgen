Climb Speed	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CloudAnchoriteClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, a cloud anchorite gains a climb speed of 10 feet. She gains a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. A cloud anchorite must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but she can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. She cannot use the run action while climbing. She retains her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against her while she is climbing. A cloud anchorite in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. As the cloud anchorite gains levels, her climb speed increases. At each odd-numbered level, she gains a +10-foot bonus to her current climb speed. If the cloud anchorite already possesses a climb speed (for example, if she possessed a racial climb speed before becoming a cloud anchorite), these bonuses stack with her current climb speed.

Empty Stride	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CloudAnchoriteClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a cloud anchorite’s stride is nearly weightless. She gains a +4 bonus on all Balance checks. More impressively, she can walk on the surface of any material into which she would normally sink, such as powdery snow, thin ice, and even water. She may continue to walk on this surface as long as she makes a DC 15 Concentration check. Normally, the Concentration check for this activity is a standard action, so a cloud anchorite may make one move action per round while using her empty stride ability. If she makes a DC 30 Concentration check, she may concentrate on her Empty Stride ability as a move action instead, allowing her to use it and still take one standard action in a round. She does not trigger traps that use pressure plates while using empty stride, nor is her speed impacted by deep snow.

She may charge over diffi cult terrain that normally slows movement. This enables her to run down steep rock faces, leap down from an outcropping, or tumble over small boulders to get to the target of her charge. Depending on the circumstances, she may still need to make appropriate checks (Jump or Tumble checks in particular) to successfully move over the terrain.

One of the cryokineticist’s clenched fists freezes into a solid block of ice that does him no harm, but causes his unarmed attacks to be treated as armed. A Medium cryokineticist deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d8 points of cold damage instead of any other special damage from the unarmed attack. The bludgeoning damage changes based on size, but the cold damage remains 1d8. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to the cryokineticist’s class level.

Death Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier, DC %1) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering her helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.|DeathAttackDC	KEY:Assassin ~ Death Attack									BONUS:VAR|DeatAttackLVL|AssassinLVL									ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Death Attack	ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Death Attack							SORTKEY:Class_Assassin	SOURCEPAGE:DMG

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, an assassin must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus (if any). When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level assassin), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a bard does. Upon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, an assassin could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highestlevel sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1stlevel spell. At 8th and 10th levels, he could trade in a single 1stlevel or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level assassin spells) for a different spell of the same level. An assassin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.

Uncanny Dodge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, an assassin gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

Improved Uncanny Dodge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, an assassin can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the assassin. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the assassin can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard's Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level blackguard), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level.

The increase in Constitution increases the defender's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shifThis position, such as Move Silently or Jump. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table 6-9). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action.

This essentially means that she adds the level of eldritch knight to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.

Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.HierophantClassFeatures.HierophantSpecialAbility.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A hierophant who selects this special ability can use one of his divine spell slots to permanently prepare one of his divine spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP. The spell normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level (or higher, if the hierophant chooses to permanently attach a metamagic feat to the spell chosen). The hierophant can use an available higher-level spell slot to use the spell-like ability more than once per day. Allocating a slot three levels higher allows him to cast the spell four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him cast it six times per day. For example, Lonafin the hierophant  wants to be able to create undead whenever he has the opportunity, so he permanently uses a 9th-level spell slot to get animate dead as a spell-like ability usable six times per day. If selected more than one time as a special ability, this ability can apply to the same spell (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

The horizon walker only gains the bonus if the Monster Manual description specifically lists the terrain type. Horizon walkers take their terrain mastery with them wherever they go. They retain their terrain mastery bonuses on skill checks, attack rolls, and damage rolls whether they're actually in the relevant terrain or not.

Summon Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade (see the Monster Manual for the shadow's statistics). Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow cannot be turned, rebuked, or commanded by any third party. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. Every third level gained by the shadowdancer adds +2 HD (and the requisite base attack and base save bonus increases) to her shadow companion. For example, a 9thlevel shadowdancer can have a shadow companion with 6 HD. If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer loses 200 experience points per shadowdancer level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss by half, to 100 XP per prestige class level. The shadowdancer's XP total can never go below 0 as the result of a shadow's dismissal or destruction. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.

Shadow Jump	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 20 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (40 feet at 6th, 80 feet at 8th, and 160 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment. (A 6th-level shadowdancer who jumps 32 feet cannot jump again until the next day.)

Defensive Roll	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 5th level, a shadowdancer can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it. Once per day, when a shadowdancer would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), she can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll. If she is in a situation that would deny her any Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't attempt a defensive roll.

Improved Uncanny Dodge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a shadowdancer can no longer be flanked, since she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadowdancer. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadowdancer can flank her (and thus sneak attack her). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as barbarian or rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

Slippery Mind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability, gained at 7th level, represents a shadowdancer's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a shadowdancer is affected by an enchantment and fails her saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw. If it fails as well, the spell's effects occur normally.

Improved Evasion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Evasion	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability, gained at 10th level, works like evasion (see above). A shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage (breath weapon, fireball, and so on). What's more, she takes only half damage even if she fails her saving throw, since her reflexes allow her to get out of harm's way with incredible speed.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThaumaturgistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a new thaumaturgist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of thaumaturgist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a thaumaturgist, he must decide to which class he adds each level of thaumaturgist for the purpose of determining spells per day.	KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Spells per Day																										SORTKEY:Class_Thaumaturgist	SOURCEPAGE:DMG	
Improved Ally	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThaumaturgistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A thaumaturgist is adept at convincing creatures from other planes to do his bidding. When a thaumaturgist casts a planar ally spell (including the lesser and greater versions), he makes a Diplomacy check to convince the creature to aid him for a reduced payment. If the thaumaturgist's Diplomacy check adjusts the creature's attitude to helpful (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Player's Handbook), the creature will work for 50%% of the standard fee, as long as the task is one that is not against its nature. For example, a 1st-level thaumaturgist negotiating with an initially friendly planar ally that gets a Diplomacy check result of 15 can convince a 6 HD creature to perform a 7- hour task for only 1,500 gp per hour (a 6 HD creature would ordinarily ask for 3,000 gp per hour). The thaumaturgist's improved ally class feature only works when the planar ally shares at least one aspect of alignment with the thaumaturgist. A thaumaturgist can have only one such ally at a time, but he may bargain for tasks from other planar allies normally.

Extended Summoning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThaumaturgistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, all spells from the summoning subschool that the thaumaturgist casts have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to them. The levels of the summoning spells don't change, however. This ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell's level.

Contingent Summoning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThaumaturgistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4th-level thaumaturgist can prepare a summoning or calling spell ahead of time to be triggered by some other event. This functions as described for the contingency spell, including having the thaumaturgist cast the summoning or calling spell beforehand. The spell is cast instantly when the trigger event occurs. For example, a thaumaturgist could use the contingent conjuration ability to summon a barbed devil the next time he is attacked, or call a ghaele eladrin to act as messenger if the king falls ill. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. If complicated or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered. The conjuration spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether the thaumaturgist wants it to, although most conjurations can be dismissed normally. A thaumaturgist can have only one contingent conjuration active at a time.	KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Contingent Summoning																										SORTKEY:Class_Thaumaturgist	SOURCEPAGE:DMG	
Planar Cohort	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThaumaturgistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 5th-level thaumaturgist can use any of the planar ally spells to call a creature to act as his cohort. The called creature serves loyally and well as long as the thaumaturgist continues to advance a cause important to the creature. For example, a 5th-level thaumaturgist could use planar ally to call a bralani eladrin to act as his cohort. As long as the thaumaturgist undertakes quests and missions to fight evil and uphold good, the eladrin will loyally serve. To call a planar cohort, the thaumaturgist must cast the relevant spell, paying the XP costs normally. It takes an offering of 1,000 gp x the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally class feature can't be used to reduce or eliminate this cost. The planar cohort can't have more Hit Dice than the thaumaturgist has, and must have an ECL no higher than the thaumaturgist's character level -2. A bralani eladrin has an ECL of 11 (6 Hit Dice and +5 level adjustment), so it might serve as a planar cohort to an 8th-level cleric/ 5th-level thaumaturgist (character level 13th). A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other called creatures normally. A planar cohort replaces a thaumaturgist's existing cohort, if he has one by virtue of the Leadership feat (page 106).
