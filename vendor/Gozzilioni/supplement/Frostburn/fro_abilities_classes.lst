Climb Speed	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.CloudAnchoriteClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, a cloud anchorite gains a climb speed of 10 feet. She gains a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. A cloud anchorite must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but she can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. She cannot use the run action while climbing. She retains her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against her while she is climbing. A cloud anchorite in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. As the cloud anchorite gains levels, her climb speed increases. At each odd-numbered level, she gains a +10-foot bonus to her current climb speed. If the cloud anchorite already possesses a climb speed (for example, if she possessed a racial climb speed before becoming a cloud anchorite), these bonuses stack with her current climb speed.

She may continue to walk on this surface as long as she makes a DC 15 Concentration check. Normally, the Concentration check for this activity is a standard action, so a cloud anchorite may make one move action per round while using her empty stride ability. If she makes a DC 30 Concentration check, she may concentrate on her Empty Stride ability as a move action instead, allowing her to use it and still take one standard action in a round. She does not trigger traps that use pressure plates while using empty stride, nor is her speed impacted by deep snow.

Primeval Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PrimevalClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The primary ability of the primeval is the supernatural ability to assume an alternate form. This functions similarly to the druid's wild shape ability, except the alternate form chosen must be selected when the character takes his fi rst level of primeval and cannot be changed after that. Each time the character changes form with this ability, he assumes the same form. At 1st level, he may change shape into his primeval form once per day. He can use this ability one additional time each day at 4th level, 7th level, and again at 10th level. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. It lasts for 1 minute per primeval level, or until he changes back. Changing form (into either form) is a standard action and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The primeval does not assume the animal's physical ability scores. Instead, he adds the animal's ability score -10 (for even scores) or -11 (for odd scores) to his own ability scores. For example, a primeval with a Strength score of 16 who assumes the form of a dire lion (Strength 25) adds +14 to his normal Strength of 16 to determine his Strength score in his primeval form. Remember, items that enhance the character's ability scores may be rendered inoperative by his change in form. The primeval loses his ability to speak while in primeval form because he is limited to the sounds that the form can make naturally. The primeval form chosen must be a prehistoric animal of some sort (dinosaur, dire animal, or other creature approved by the DM). The primeval form chosen must have no more than 8 HD and cannot be more than one size category larger than the primeval (so a Small character is limited to Medium animals or smaller, and a Medium character is limited to Large or smaller animals). The primeval form can be from any terrain familiar to the character. Appropriate primeval forms for a frostfell environment from the Monster Manual and this book include the dire lion, dire wolf, dire wolverine, and megaloceros. If the primeval has the wild shape ability from other class levels, he may use wild shape to assume his primeval form. He cannot use his primeval form ability to wild shape, however.

Regression	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PrimevalClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a primeval gains levels, he begins to physically regress into a more primal, feral version of himself. At 2nd level, the primeval reduces his Intelligence and Charisma scores by 1 point (to a minimum of 3) and gains 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom. At 5th level, he repeats his regression, losing an additional point of Intelligence and Charisma, and gaining an additional point to the rest of his ability scores. At 8th level, the primeval regresses again, losing a third point of Intelligence and Charisma but gaining a third point to the rest of his ability scores.

Rimefire Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.RimefireWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A rimefire witch becomes bonded on a deeply spiritual level with the rimefire eidolon that selected her as its guardian. Both the witch and the eidolon are constantly aware of the other's location and condition, as if both were under the effects of a status spell. This is a permanent effect that cannot be dispelled or destroyed. The bond also shores up the mind and will to live of the witch and her eidolon; both gain a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting and death effects while the other is alive. A rimefire bond is powerful enough that it even extends across planes. If a rimefire witch or her eidolon is killed, this bond is broken. A surviving rimefire witch loses all her supernatural and spell-like abilities granted by this class (but not her spellcasting ability) until she restores the slain eidolon to life and returns it to its iceberg. A surviving eidolon does not lose any of its abilities, and typically waits for a year before sending out a call for a new guardian. If the slain member of the bond is brought back to life within a year of death, the rimefire bond instantly reforges itself despite any physical distance between the two. If more than a year has passed, the rimefire witch does not regain her powers but within a week she is contacted in her dreams by a new rimefire eidolon; once she travels to its iceberg and accepts its bond of rimefire she immediately regains her lost powers.

Magic weapons that deal cold damage (such as frost weapons) do not trigger this additional cold damage, since the source of the cold damage is the weapon itself, not the winterhaunt. The winterhaunt's coldstrike damage increases to +2d6 points of cold damage at 8th level. When his cloak of winter's chill is active, he adds an additional 1d6 points of damage with his coldstrike ability (to a total of +2d6 at 4th level and +3d6 at 8th level).

Cold Subtype	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WinterhauntOfIborighuClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 7th level, the winterhaunt gains the cold subtype. He gains immunity to cold, but also has a vulnerability to fire, which means he takes half again as much (+50%%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether or not a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or a failure.

Summon the Entombed	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WinterhauntOfIborighuClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 9th level, a winterhaunt gains the spell-like ability to summon one of the entombed to do his bidding. Treat this as a summon monster IX spell, except that the winterhaunt can only summon entombed with it. The caster level of this ability is equal to the winterhaunt's class level plus his Charisma modifi er. The winterhaunt may use this spell-like ability once per day. For more information on entombed, see page 128.

Wintry Apotheosys	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WinterhauntOfIborighuClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 10th level, the winterhaunt undergoes a powerful and unholy transformation as his flesh and bones become consumed by the frozen wrath of Iborighu, only to be replaced by snowy fl esh and icy bones. The winterhaunt has become a powerful supernatural servant of Iborighu. Once this apotheosis takes place, the winterhaunt's type changes to elemental, and he gains the evil subtype. As a being composed of living, profane ice and snow, he is immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. He is also not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. The winter haunt cannot be raised, reincarnated or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore life). The winterhaunt also gains dark vision out to 60 feet. The winterhaunt's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
