Once a dracotaur spits, it cannot spit again for 1 minute. The dracotaur's spittle is a sticky adhesive substance that ignites when exposed to air, much like alchemist's fire.

Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the spittle hits takes 1d4 points of fire damage from the splash. Unlike alchemist's fi re, a dracotaur's spittle does not continue to burn.

It creates a 10-foot cone of sand, doing 1d8 points of damage (Refl ex DC 22 half). Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by itching skin and burning eyes, imposing a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitutionbased. (It relies on the user's ability to blow a hearty gust of air through the tube.) A sand blaster uses 5 pounds of sand as ammunition, and packing a sand blaster with one charge of ammunition is a full-round action.

Shifting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ShifterRaceTrait.RaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A shifter can tap into his lycanthropic heritage to gain short bursts of physical power. Once per day, a shifter can enter a state that is superfi cially similar to a barbarian's rage. Each shifter has one of six shifter traits - a characteristic that manifests when he is shifting. Each shifter trait provides a +2 bonus to a physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) and grants some other advantage as well. Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shifter's Con modifi er. (If a shifter trait or other effect increases the shifter's Con modifi er, use the newly improved modifi er.) A shifter can take feats to improve this ability (see Shifter Feats, below). Every shifter feat a shifter takes increases the duration of shifting by 1 round. For every two shifter feats a shifter takes, the number of times per day he can tap into the ability increases by one. So, a shifter with two shifter feats can shift two times per day (instead of the usual one), and each use of the ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 (instead of 3) + the shifter's Con modifi er.

Composite Plating	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WarforgedRaceTrait.RaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The plating used to build a warforged provides a +2 armor bonus. This plating is not natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same space on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus a warforged cannot wear armor or magic robes. A warforged can be enchanted just as armor can be. The creature must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant him. Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5%% arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for wearing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged to ignore the arcane spell failure chance for light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.

Impale	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CadaverCollectorRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a cadaver collector has successfully grappled a Medium or smaller creature, it can attempt to impale the creature on its back spikes by making a successful grapple check. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the collector successfully impales a creature, the creature takes 4d8+%1 points of damage and is considered pinned. Each round, the creature takes another 2d8 points of damage as the movement of the cadaver collector causes additional pain to the impaled creature. The creature cannot break free unless it makes a DC 28 Strength check. Success indicates the creature is free of the spike but takes an additional 2d8 points of damage in the process. Failure means the creature takes 4d8 points of damage and remains pinned in place. An ally can try to free an impaled creature with a DC 20 Strength check. Once a cadaver collector has a creature or creatures impaled on its back spikes, it is no longer considered to be in a grapple and can attack other opponents without penalty. It cannot use its slam attacks against impaled opponents. Creatures that get free of a cadaver collector become its immediate and most urgent targets. It typically pursues such creatures exclusively if it has any chance of catching and impaling them again. A cadaver collector's back spikes can hold up to 4 Medium creatures, 16 Small creatures, or 64 Tiny creatures. Creatures smaller than Tiny are too miniscule to be impaled on the collector's back spikes, although the collector can still deal 4d8+15 points of damage to such opponents by grinding them into its back spikes with a successful grapple check once it has them grappled.|STR*3/2	KEY:Cadaver Collector ~ Impale																											SOURCEPAGE:MM3

Immunity to Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CadaverCollectorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Like golems, cadaver collectors are especially resilient to magic. However, this resilience takes a slightly different form in the cadaver collector. A cadaver collector is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, spells of 3rd level or lower that target a cadaver collector automatically rebound back at their caster as if the collector were under the effects of an unbeatable spell turning effect. This effect cannot be dispelled or suppressed, except against spells that deal electricity damage (see below). Spells that deal rust damage or alter stone penetrate the immunity to magic. Other spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals sonic damage slows a cadaver collector (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. Sonic spells of 3rd level or lower are absorbed by the collector and not refl ected. A magical attack that deals electricity damage is absorbed rather than refl ected. Such an attack breaks any slow effect on the collector and heals 1d6 points of damage for every 6 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the collector to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A cadaver collector is affected normally by rust attacks. In addition, magical attacks that alter the nature of stone, such as transmute rock to mud, deal 1d6 points of damage per spell level to the cadaver collector.

Aura of Loss	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemonSorrowswornRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A sorrowsworn demon radiates feelings of intense personal loss. Any creature within 30 feet of a sorrowsworn demon must make a DC %1 Will save or be overwhelmed with feelings of despair as they continually visualize the most terrible losses they've ever endured or can imagine happening. These feelings manifest as a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. An opponent that fails this save and has also had its mind read by the sorrowsworn demon is more likely to fall victim to its whispers of loss (see below). In addition, due to the distracting nature of the aura, any affected creatures that attempt to cast spells must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to avoid losing the spell. This ability lasts for as long as affected creatures remain within the area of the aura and for 2d6 rounds after they leave. Creatures that leave the aura and reenter must make another save upon reentry or be affected once more, regardless of whether they made their initial saving throw. The sorrowsworn demon can suppress or activate this ability at will as a free action. This is a mind-affecting ability.

Whispers of Loss	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemonSorrowswornRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A sorrowsworn demon preys on an enemy's feelings of loss, both real and projected. While engaged in combat, it whispers and hisses constantly, both aloud and in the minds of those creatures that can understand it. A sorrowsworn demon can intensify these whispers, focusing them as a free action each round on one target within 60 feet that can understand it. Each round, it can change targets at will (this is also a free action, although the previous victim might suffer lasting effects from the whispers of loss, as described below). These intensifi ed whispers of loss have different effects, depending on the sorrowsworn demon's whims and tactics. Any creature that has succumbed to both a sorrowsworn demon's aura of loss and mind reading abilities takes an additional -2 penalty on any saves to resist the sorrowsworn demon's whispers. Whispers of loss is a mind-affecting ability and only functions against creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw against a whispers of loss effect is immune to that effect (but not the other effects) for 24 hours. Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DinosaurBattletitanRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A battletitan can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of up to two sizes smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check. The swallowed creature takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage and 12 points of acid damage per round from the dinosaur's gizzard. Swallowed creatures must also make a DC 37 Fortitude saving throw each round or be overcome with nausea until their next action (the save DC is Constitution-based). While in the gizzard, the opponent is still considered grappled due to a battletitan's powerful digestive muscles. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 30 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 18). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge battletitan's gizzard can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, 8 Tiny, 32 Diminutive, or 128 Fine opponents.	KEY:Dinosaur (Battletitan) ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM3	
Training	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DinosaurBattletitanRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The techniques for training one of these powerful dinosaurs are as closely guarded as the means of breeding them. Training a young battletitan requires six months of work and a DC 28 Handle Animal check; battletitans cannot be domesticated if they reach adulthood without having been trained. Battletitans are naturally sterile, and each specimen is the product of direct crossbreeding of other dinosaurs. As a result, a young battletitan that makes it to the open market commands whatever price the market can bear, which is often more than 100,000 gp. Any such sales are likely to attract the attention of the kingdom from which the creature was pilfered, of course.

Training	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DinosaurBloodstrikerRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In places where dinosaurs are used as mounts, bloodstrikers are greatly prized because of their defensive capabilities. Trainers and riders must exercise great personal care when working with these creatures, however, because their spiked hide and defensive abilities present additional challenges. When attempting to teach a bloodstriker to take a rider or perform tasks, the trainer must decide whether to take extra precautions (increasing the training time by 50%%), or to work with it in the standard amount of time (taking a -4 circumstance penalty on all Handle Animal checks to teach, train, or rear). Riding a bloodstriker is equally challenging. All ride checks are made with a -4 circumstance penalty. In addition, a rider requires a specially made exotic saddle. Someone foolish enough to attempt to ride the creature bareback or with a noncustomized saddle takes 1d8+6 points of piercing and slashing damage from its spiked skin upon mounting it or whenever a Ride check is required.

This ability functions much like the pounce special attack. However, a fl eshraker's incredible jumping ability makes its leaping pounce particularly deadly. When a fl eshraker charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including one rake attack. If a fl eshraker successfully hits and damages a target of its size or smaller that it pounces on during a charge, it can make a free trip attack without provoking attacks of opportunity. If the fl eshraker wins the opposed trip check, it can make an immediate grapple check. If it succeeds, the opponent is considered grappled and pinned on the ground beneath the fl eshraker. On each subsequent round, the fl eshraker can deal automatic claw and rake damage with a successful grapple check against a pinned opponent. If a f leshraker fails the opposed trip check, it cannot be tripped in return.

Each nodule is a grenadelike weapon that deals 5d6 points of piercing damage and 5d6 points of fire damage in a 10-foot spread (DC %1 Reflex half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. A healthy geriviar normally carries twelve nodules at a given time. Nodules take 3d6 minutes to grow back once broken off. A geriviar can regrow multiple nodules at the same time.

Living creatures within 100 feet that hear this keening must make a DC %1 Will save. Success indicates that the creature is shaken until it can no longer hear the keening or moves out of range. Failure causes the creature to be panicked for as long as it can hear the keening and remains within range, and shaken for 24 hours afterward. Ending the frightful keening is a standard action.

This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Any creature that dies within 15 feet of a death giant has its spirit sucked up into the swirling guardian souls that protect the death giant. Such creatures cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated so long as the death giant lives. Killing the death giant releases the souls. If a living death giant is within 15 feet of a death giant that dies, the souls are not released and are instead transferred to the nearby death giant due to its steal soul ability.

Guardian Souls	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantDeathRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A death giant's victims become its guardians in death. Each death giant is surrounded by a constantly swirling cloud of intangible spirits. These spirits provide the death giant with warnings and protection, granting the creature a bonus on initiative rolls, saves, Listen checks, and Spot checks equal to its Charisma modifier. A death giant's will binds its guardian souls to it. They are not ghosts or undead in the usual sense and cannot be damaged, dispelled, or separated from the death giant. Only a successful turning attempt can quell these spirits for a time. If the turning attempt would turn or rebuke an undead with Hit Dice equal to the death giant's, the guardian souls vanish for 1d10 rounds, and the death giant loses the benefits of its guardian souls, frightful keening, soul healing, and steal soul abilities until the souls return.

Beguiling Song	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GlaistigRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A glaistig can attempt to beguile creatures with its song. A glaistig sings, targeting a single creature it can see within 300 yards of the body of water to which it is linked (see Water Symbiosis, below). This is a sonic charm effect, and the creature must be able to hear the glaistig for it to take effect. The targeted creature must make a DC %1 Will saving throw. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same glaistig's song for 24 hours. Failure indicates the creature is beguiled and moves toward the glaistig, taking the most direct route available. If that path leads into a dangerous area (such as very deep or fast-moving water), the beguiled creature gets a second saving throw. If that save is successful, the beguiling effect is broken, and that creature cannot be affected by that glaistig's song for 24 hours. A glaistig that desires a companion often moves out of the water and bestows water breathing upon its beguiled victim so it can take him underwater. A beguiled creature takes no actions other than to defend himself. (Thus, a fighter cannot run away or attack, but takes no defensive penalties.) A beguiled victim that moves within 5 feet of the glaistig must make a DC 19 Will saving throw or be charmed, as by the charm monster spell cast by an 8th-level sorcerer. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same glaistig's song for 24 hours. The beguiling effect continues so long as the glaistig sings. A glaistig does not need to continue singing to keep a victim charmed. A glaistig can use its beguiling song both above and below the water. Most glaistigs move into deep water, forcing a beguiled victim to move toward them. If these unlucky creatures fail their second saving throw, they usually drown (see page 304 of Dungeon Master's Guide). The save DC is Charisma-based.|BeguilingSongDC	KEY:Glaistig ~ Beguiling Song				DEFINE:BeguilingSongDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BeguilingSongDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|BeguilingSongDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Beguiling Song)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Beguiling Song									SOURCEPAGE:MM3

A glaistig cannot move more than 300 yards away from its body of water and still breathe normally. If a glaistig strays farther away, it must hold its breath or immediately start to suffocate (see Suffocation, page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Once a glaistig has moved beyond the boundary of its connection, it cannot breathe normally until it has immersed itself in its body of water.

Such creatures can hear the subsonic speech of gulgars using the normal Listen check rules; they do not need to have the speaking gulgar within the range of their tremorsense, blindsense, or blindsight ability. A gulgar's subsonic speech carries fi ve times as well and as far as normal speech. This means that to hear a gulgar talking, a creature who can hear the subsonic speech takes a -1 penalty on Listen checks per 50 feet of distance from the speaker. A door increases the Listen DC by just 1, and a stone wall increases it by 3. These modifi ers replace those given on page 78 of the Player's Handbook. Creatures without the ability to hear the subsonic speech of gulgars can still read their lips using the Spot skill. The base DC to read a gulgar's lips is 20, and the creature reading lips must speak Terran.	KEY:Gulgar ~ Subsonic Speech																											SOURCEPAGE:MM3

Harpooning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HarpoonSpiderRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As ranged attacks, a harpoon spider can fire one or two of its fangs up to 20 feet (no range increment). The spider can fire at two different targets if it chooses. A successful hit deals 1d4+1 points of damage as the harpoon hooks the flesh of the target and immediately exudes a thick, sticky glue. The spider can reel in a harpoon as a free action; treat this as a trip attack (+11 bonus) against any creature attached to the fang. Failure indicates that the harpoon rips free (and deals another 1d4+1 points of damage to the victim). Success indicates that the victim is pulled off its feet and dragged back to the spider, who can immediately make a free bite attack against the victim. A harpoon spider can only pull a creature smaller than itself in this manner. Attempts to retract a creature of its own size or larger automatically cause the fang to rip free as if the trip attack failed. The glue exuded by the spider's fangs decomposes quickly, and at the end of the spider's turn the fang automatically detaches.

(Creatures wielding reach weapons, such as long spears, are not subject to this damage.) The spines also deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on a successful grapple check (much like armor spikes). The save DC is Dexterity-based. As a full-round action, a harpoon spider can pick up a Medium or smaller helpless creature with its legs and impale the body on its spines, dealing 2d6 points of piercing damage. The spider can carry up to 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller creatures in this manner.

Any creature that comes within 5 feet of a harssaf automatically takes 1d6 points of fi re damage per round, and any creature struck by a harssaf's melee attacks takes an extra 1d6 points of fi re damage.

Shake the Earth	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KnellBeetleRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A knell beetle can channel some of the sonic energy within its body by performing a rhythmic stomping on the ground as a standard action. Any creature within 5 feet of a knell beetle when it activates this ability must make a DC %1 Reflex save or fall prone as the ground lurches and buckles beneath it. Knell beetles are immune to shake the earth generated by themselves or other knell beetles and never need to save against the effect. If multiple knell beetles activate their shake the earth ability in the same round, the radius of the effect expands as the resonance in the ground combines. For every knell beetle within 5 feet using shake the earth, the radius of the effect expands by another 5 feet. Thus, two knell beetles within 5 feet of one another generate a shaking that affects all creatures within 10 feet of either knell beetle. Three knell beetles within 5 feet using the ability would generate an effect that affects all creatures within 15 feet of any one of the knell beetles. Creatures with stability or that are considered stable against trip attempts receive a bonus on their Refl ex save as if they were being tripped (so a dwarf would receive the +4 bonus on the save to resist being knocked prone).

Wisdom Damage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MindshredderLarvaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A mindshredder larva deals hit point damage as well as 1 point of Wisdom damage each time it hits a living creature with a tentacle attack. A mindshredder larva can also use a tentacle to make a touch attack. If successful, the touch attack deals no hit point damage but still deals 1 point of Wisdom damage. If a mindshredder larva grapples an opponent, that opponent takes an extra 1 point of Wisdom damage at the beginning of each of the mindshredder larva's turns. For each point of Wisdom damage that a mind shredder larva deals, it heals 2 hit points of damage.

Thought Sense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MindshredderLarvaRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:All mindshredders are sensitive to the thought emanations of living creatures. A mindshredder larva usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to pinpoint the location of a living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher within 20 feet. Any opponent a mindshredder cannot see still has total concealment against the mindshredder, and the mind shredder still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. A mindshredder is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. A mindshredder need not have line of effect to a creature to detect it. A mindshredder's thought sense ability can penetrate barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. Any creature immune to mind-reading effects (such as a character under the effect of mind blank) can't be detected with thought sense.

Once the chrysalis is complete, a larva must remain in the chrysalis for one month. At the end of the month, it emerges from the chrysalis as a mindshredder Warrior. A mindshredder larva's chrysalis has a hardness of 5 and 45 hit points (each chrysalis is 3 inches thick and has 15 hit points per inch of thickness). The hardened resin of a mindshredder larva's chrysalis is pale rose in color. A larva inside a chrysalis is helpless and dies if the chrysalis is destroyed.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OdopiRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Although an odopi lacks a mouth in the usual sense, it can swallow foes by passing them through its forest of arms to the center of its body. If an odopi begins its turn while pinning a Medium or smaller creature, it can move the pinned foe into its stomach (dealing the bludgeoning and acid damage given below) in lieu of making a grapple check to deal damage. A swallowed creature is considered grappled, but the odopi is not. A swallowed creature takes 1d8+10 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d8 points of acid damage each round. A creature can cut its way out by using a light piercing or slashing weapon to deal 40 points of damage to the stomach (AC 17). Once a creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. Regardless of how it escapes, a creature that exits the stomach is back in the odopi's many arms and the creature is automatically considered grappled. An odopi's stomach can hold 1 Medium, 4 Small, 16 Tiny, 64 Diminutive, or 256 Fine creatures.	KEY:Odopi ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM3

Split	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ProteanScourgeRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When damaged, a protean scourge splits into two identical versions of itself.

However, any spells cast by either split protean scourge come from the total pool of remaining available spells.

Neither half of the protean scourge can change shape as long as the creature remains split.

Pain Toxin	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SeryulinRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Any living creature struck by a seryulin's slam attack is exposed to a substance secreted by the cilia around its upper body. Contact with this substance causes the target excruciating pain, and the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage in the round after being struck.

Sticky Spray	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SeryulinRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a seryulin can use a standard action to expel a 20-foot-radius burst of viscous goo from its body. Any creature in the area becomes entangled and must succeed on a DC %1 Refl ex save or become glued to the ground, unable to move. A fl ying creature is not stuck to the ground, but it must succeed on the save or be unable to fl y and fall to the ground. Seryulins, as well as their riders, are unaffected by the sticky spray. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature stuck to the ground can break free by making a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape the stuff off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that scored the hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness.

At the mere sight of an illuminated shimmerling swarm, a creature within 300 feet must succeed on a DC %1 Will save or be fascinated for as long as the swarm is in sight. Any potential threat allows another saving throw against the effect, and an obvious threat automatically frees the creature from the effect, as does vigorous shaking. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to that shimmerling swarm's hypnotic form for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

In that round and every round thereafter, a grappled victim takes 1d4 points of damage plus 1d4 points of Strength damage. A creature reduced to 0 Strength by a vasuthant dies. This is a negative energy effect. Every point of Strength damage dealt by a vasuthant heals the creature of 1 point of damage, or gives it 1 temporary hit point if the creature is at full normal hit points. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes. A vasuthant can grapple with one creature of its size, or can simultaneously grapple one or two creatures one size smaller or up to four creatures two or more sizes smaller. Creatures that become pinned are suspended inside the vasuthant while their life energy is crushed out of their bodies. The use of its enervating crush ability does not prevent a vasuthant from making slam attacks or using its spell-like abilities.

When confronted by a humanoid with a Charisma score higher than its own, a visilight attempts to grapple and pin it. Any living creature pinned by a visilight takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain each round on the visilight's turn. As the visilight begins absorbing its victim's personality, its mask begins to reshape itself to more closely resemble the visage of the individual being drained. For every point of Charisma it drains, a visilight's Charisma score temporarily increases by 1.

This attack deals 1d6 points of acid damage per Hit Die of the voidmind creature (maximum 20d6). A successful Refl ex save (DC %1 ) halves the damage. In addition, any creature that takes damage from the spray takes a -2 penalty on its Will saves and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds (Fortitude save negates the stun; save DC same as above).

KEY:Voidmind Creature ~ Constrict																											SOURCEPAGE:MM3	
Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VoidmindCreatureRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:To use this ability, a voidmind creature must hit a creature of its size category or smaller with its tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. A voidmind creature has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks made with its tentacle. If the creature wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.	KEY:Voidmind Creature ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:MM3	
Sentient Tentacle	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VoidmindCreatureRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A voidmind creature's tentacle attacks of its own accord. The creature can direct it to attack certain targets, but the psionic nature of the tentacle enables it to fl ex and move in combat without hindering the creature's other combat abilities. A voidmind grimlock that has successfully grappled a creature with its tentacle can attack another creature at no penalty, as long as that creature is within a distance equal to the tentacle's reach.	KEY:Voidmind Creature ~ Sentient Tentacle																											SOURCEPAGE:MM3	
Mind Flayer Host	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VoidmindCreatureRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Three mind fl ayers form a bond with any voidmind creature they create. A different mind fl ayer cannot bond itself to a voidmind creature after creation. The creature's masters are instantly aware if the creature takes any damage, wanders out of range of their control, or is the target of any magic. Also as a result of this bond, the masters can, as a standard action, see and hear through the eyes and ears of their bonded voidmind creature to a range of fi ve miles. Maintaining this link requires a mind fl ayer to concentrate, but the mind fl ayer remains aware of its surroundings and can move normally. Finally, any one of the three masters can take control of the voidmind creature, at will, as the dominate monster spell (no save). While controlling the voidmind creature in this fashion, a mind fl ayer can manifest its own innate psionic abilities through the voidmind creature, as though the creature were manifesting the ability itself. Any of the mind fl ayer's psionic powers used in this fashion can target or affect creatures within range, line of sight, and line of effect of the voidmind creature. So, for example, a mind fl ayer can use plane shift to send the voidmind creature to another plane, or it could send itself to another plane. Likewise, the mind fl ayer could use suggestion on a target it sees through the voidmind creature's eyes.

Blindsight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YugolothCanolothRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Canoloths can ascertain all foes within 40 feet as a sighted creature would.

Negating a canoloth's sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both senses are negated, the canoloth is effectively blinded.
