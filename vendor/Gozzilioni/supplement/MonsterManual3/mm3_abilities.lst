Razorclaw	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ShifterTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:While shifting, a razorclaw shifter gains a +2 bonus to Strength and grows claws that can be used as natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels he has) with each successful attack. He can attack with one claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack action (as a primary natural weapon). He cannot attack more than once per round with a single claw, even if his base attack bonus is high enough to give him multiple attacks. He can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while wielding a weapon in his primary hand, but all his attacks in that round take a -2 penalty.

Wildhunt	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ShifterTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:While shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and the scent ability. This ability allows the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can identify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights. A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait. When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location of the source isn't revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within 5 feet of the source, he pinpoints the source’s location. While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the Track feat can follow tracks by smell, making Wisdom (or Survival) checks to fi nd or follow a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the surface that holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures producing the odor, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail grows cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Wildhunt shifters tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility. When not shifted, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus to Survival checks due to the lingering effects of the scent ability.
