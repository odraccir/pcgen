You can sacrifice any amount of your own divine grace, up to your full Charisma bonus. You can divide that bonus among allies that you touch, to a maximum of one ally per character level you possess. For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin with a +3 Charisma bonus, you can give three characters each a +1 bonus on their saving throws, one character a +3 bonus, two characters a +1 bonus (keeping a +1 bonus for yourself ), or any similar division of your +3 bonus.

You can sense the presence of creatures of this type within 60 feet, as well as pinpoint their exact location (distance and direction) relative to you. Normal barriers and obstructions do not block this supernatural ability, allowing you to sense the presence and location of creatures behind doors or walls, for example. This feat does not allow you to see an invisible or hidden creature (although you can still discern its location). In addition to sensing the presence of your favored enemy, you deal +1d6 points of damage on weapon attack rolls made against evil representatives of the favored enemy creature type.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|Special Ability|PC[TYPE=FavoredEnemy]														SOURCEPAGE:BoED

Nonlethel Substitution	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE.Metamagic																		DESC:Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can modify a spell with the chosen designator to deal nonlethal damage instead of energy damage. The altered spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt. For example, a nonlethal fireball spell works in the usual way except it deals nonlethal damage instead of fire damage. A nonlethal spell uses a spell slot of the spell's normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats.							ADDSPELLLEVEL:0										SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Nymph's Kiss	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES																		PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:Fey creatures regard you as though you were fey. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma-related checks, and a +1 bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. Starting with the level when you take this feat, you gain 1 extra skill point per level.

Purify Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES																		PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:A spell you modify with this feat gains the good descriptor. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, neutral creatures take half damage, or one-quarter with a successful saving throw (if allowed), while good creatures take no damage at all. Evil outsiders affected by the spell take extra damage: The spell's damage is increased by one die type (each 1d6 becomes 1d8, each 1d8 becomes 2d6, and so on, using the same progression as weapons increasing in size). For example, a purified lightning bolt cast by a 7th-level wizard deals 7d6 points of electricity damage to evil creatures, half damage to neutral creatures, and no damage at all to good creatures caught in its path. Evil outsiders (except ones immune to electricity) take 7d8 points of damage. A purified spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.							ADDSPELLLEVEL:1							BONUS:VAR|DodgeBonus|1			SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Purify Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:This feat adds the good descriptor to a spell-like ability. Furthermore, if the ability deals damage, neutral creatures take half damage, or one-quarter with a successful saving throw (if allowed), while good creatures take no damage at all. Evil outsiders affected by the ability take extra damage: The ability's damage is increased by one die type (each 1d6 becomes 1d8, each 1d8 becomes 2d6, and so on, using the same progression as weapons increasing in size). For example purified lightning bolt cast by an avoral deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to evil creatures, half damage to neutral creatures, and no damage at all to good creatures caught in its path. Evil outsiders (except ones immune to electricity) take 8d8 points of damage. Each of your spell-like abilities can be purified three times per day, though this feat does not allow you to exceed your normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a tulani eladrin chooses to purify its chain lightning ability, it can use a purified chain lightning up to three times that day. Thereafter, it could use its chain lightning ability again normally (since it can use chain lightning at will), or it could purify another of its spell-like abilities, such as meteor swarm.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Purify Spell Trigger	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wand,Craft Staff	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Turn Undead													PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:When you use a spell trigger item, such as a wand or staff, you can use one of your turning attempts for the day to trigger the item. You still expend a charge from the wand or staff. The spell cast by the item is modified as though it had the Purify Spell feat applied to it.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Quell the Profane	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES		PRETOTALAB:8		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack,Resounding Blow									PRESTAT:1,STR=13					PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:Whenever you deal a critical hit to an evil creature using a melee weapon with which you are proficient, your opponent must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) or take 1d4+1 points of temporary Strength damage. A monk's unarmed strike is considered a melee weapon for purposes of this feat.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Ranged Smite Evil	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Smite Evil														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:Your smite evil ability can be channeled through a missile that you fire.

A monk's unarmed strike is considered a melee weapon for purposes of this feat.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Righteous Wrath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:When you first deal damage with a melee attack against an evil foe during your rage, that creature must make a successful Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your raging class level + your Cha modifier) or be shaken. If you fail to affect a creature the first time you hit it, you cannot affect it in that encounter. The shaken effect remains until you withdraw or are killed or incapacitated. While raging, you maintain clarity of mind unusual among barbarians. You are perfectly able to deal nonlethal damage, stop your attacks to show mercy, and distinguish friend from foe even in the heat of your rage.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Sacred Strike	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Sneak Attack														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:When you use your sneak attack ability against an evil creature, roll d8s for your sneak attack dice (instead of d6s) and your sneak attack damage is considered good-aligned for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Sacred Vow	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES																		PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:When you use a projectile weapon, such as a bow, its range increment increases by one-half (multiply by 1-1/2). When you use a thrown weapon, its range increment is doubled.													BONUS:SKILL|Diplomacy|2|TYPE=Perfection				SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Sanctify Ki Strike	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike									PRESTAT:1,CHA=15					PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG	PREVARGTEQ:KiStrikeLawful,1			DESC:Your unarmed strikes deal 1 extra point of damage to evil creatures, or 1d4 points to evil outsiders and evil undead.

In addition, your natural attacks are considered good-aligned for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Sanctify Weapon	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PRESPELL:1,Align Weapon														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:When you cast align weapon, the affected weapon also becomes sanctified. A sanctified weapon deals 1 extra point of holy damage to evil creatures or 1d4 points of damage to evil outsiders and evil undead. In addition, creatures with the corrupted template (described in the Book of Vile Darkness) cannot recover hit point damage dealt by a sanctified weapon by means of normal healing, including fast healing.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Servant of the Heavens	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE.AllegianceTier														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:Once per day, while performing an act of good, you may call upon your archon patron to gain a +1 luck bonus on any one roll or check.

Stigmata	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nimbus of Light														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:You can heal the wounds and ailments of others using your own life energy. When you activate this ability, as a free action, you immediately take at least 2 points of temporary Constitution damage. You can take as many points of Constitution damage as you wish, as long as you remain alive and conscious. Once you have activated your stigmata, you can touch your allies to heal them of 1 point of damage per level they possess for every 2 points of Constitution damage you take. In addition, any character you touch who is suffering from a disease can immediately make a new saving throw against that disease with a sacred bonus equal to the number of points of Constitution damage you took. If the character succeeds on that saving throw, she is freed from the disease. You can use this touch on one ally per point of Constitution damage you take. As with delivering a touch spell, you can touch up to six allies as a full-round action. A single person can only benefit once from each activation of your stigmata, but each activation lasts for 1 hour. For example, if you sacrifice 4 points of Constitution, you can grant four allies a number of hit points of healing equal to twice their level. Each ally who was suffering from a disease would make a new saving throw with a +4 sacred bonus. If only two of your allies were wounded at the time you activated the stigmata, you could "save" the other two uses for up to 1 hour, in case other characters become wounded within that time. Even if the characters you originally healed were injured again, however, they could not benefit from the same activation of your stigmata. When you use this ability, the wounds on your body bleed in proportion to the Constitution damage you take. The bleeding persists for 1 hour, and the Constitution damage cannot be restored by any means until the bleeding has stopped. Once the bleeding has stopped, you can freely activate the stigmata again, whether or not you have recovered your lost Constitution, as long as you have enough Constitution left to use the ability and survive.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Subduing Strike	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Fighter	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You can use any melee weapon to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on your attack roll. If you are a rogue, you can deal nonlethal damage with your sneak attack even if you are using a normal melee weapon. This feat does not allow you to deal nonlethal damage with ranged weapons.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Touch of Golden Ice	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,CON=13					PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:Any evil creature you touch with your bare hand, fist, or natural weapon is ravaged by golden ice (see Ravages and Afflictions in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment for effects).																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Vow of Abstinence	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sacred Vow														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poisons and drugs (as long as you are subjected to a drug unwillingly). Special: To fulfill your vow, you must not consume intoxicating, stimulating, depressant, or hallucinogenic substances, including alcohol, caffeine, and other drugs. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion, or otherwise unintentionally (a drug slipped into your drink, for example), you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell. 														BONUS:VAR|PoisonResistanceBonus|4|TYPE=Perfection			SOURCEPAGE:BoED	ABILITY:Special Ability|VIRTUAL|Resistance to Poison					
Vow of Chastity	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sacred Vow														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Will saving throws against charm and phantasm spells and effects. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must abstain from any sexual contact with any other creature. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.														BONUS:VAR|CharmResistanceBonus|4|TYPE=Perfection			SOURCEPAGE:BoED	ABILITY:Special Ability|VIRTUAL|Resistance to Charm					
Vow of Non-Violence	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sacred Vow														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:The saving throw DC for spells you cast or other special abilities you use against humanoid or monstrous humanoid targets is increased by +4 if the spell does not deal damage (including ability damage but not nonlethal damage), bestow negative levels, or cause death. Spells affected by this feat include most Abjuration, Enchantment, and Illusion spells (though not phantasmal killer, for example), those few Divination spells that have targets and require saving throws (including detect thoughts and discern lies), and even Necromancy spells such as waves of fatigue and ray of exhaustion. It does not affect most Evocation, Conjuration, and Transmutation spells. The bonus granted by this feat does not stack with the bonus granted by the Spell Focus feat. It affects only saving throw Dcs, not caster level checks or other elements of a spell.																	SOURCEPAGE:BoED						
Vow of Obedience	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sacred Vow														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Will saving throws against compulsion spells and effects. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must unquestioningly obey your superior and live according to the rules of your organization.

Vow of Peace	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sacred Vow														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG			DEFINE:VowOfPeaceBonus|0	DESC:This sacred vow grants significant supernatural benefits, but its cost is high. First, you are constantly surrounded by a calming aura to a radius of 20 feet. Creatures within the aura must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Cha modifier) or be affected as by the calm emotions spell. Creatures who leave the aura and reenter it receive new saving throws. A creature that makes a successful saving throw and remains in the aura is unaffected until it leaves the aura and reenters. The aura is a mind-affecting, supernatural compulsion. Second, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus to your AC, a +2 deflection bonus to your AC, and a +2 exalted bonus to your AC. This exalted bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore it. It does not stack with an armor bonus. If you also have the Vow of Poverty feat, the natural armor, deflection, and exalted Armor Class bonuses granted by that feat all increase by +2. If a creature strikes you with a manufactured weapon, the weapon must immediately make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Con modifier) or shatter against your skin, leaving you unharmed.  Finally, you gain a +4 exalted bonus on all Diplomacy checks. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must not cause harm to any living creature (constructs and undead are not included in this prohibition). You may not deal real damage or ability damage to such creatures through spells or weapons, though you may deal nonlethal damage. You may not target them with death effects, disintegrate, or other spells that have the immediate potential to cause death or great harm. You also may not use nondamaging spells to incapacitate or weaken living foes so that your allies can kill them-if you incapacitate a foe, you must take him prisoner. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion or otherwise unwittingly, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell. (Characters who have taken a Vow of Peace are known to drink water through a strainer in order to avoid accidentally swallowing, and thereby causing harm to, a small insect.)

First, you are constantly surrounded by a calming aura to a radius of 20 feet. Creatures within the aura must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Cha modifier) or be affected as by the calm emotions spell. Creatures who leave the aura and reenter it receive new saving throws. A creature that makes a successful saving throw and remains in the aura is unaffected until it leaves the aura and reenters.

This exalted bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore it. It does not stack with an armor bonus. If you also have the Vow of Poverty feat, the natural armor, deflection, and exalted Armor Class bonuses granted by that feat all increase by +2. If a creature strikes you with a manufactured weapon, the weapon must immediately make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Con modifier) or shatter against your skin, leaving you unharmed.  Finally, you gain a +4 exalted bonus on all Diplomacy checks. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must not cause harm to any living creature (constructs and undead are not included in this prohibition). You may not deal real damage or ability damage to such creatures through spells or weapons, though you may deal nonlethal damage. You may not target them with death effects, disintegrate, or other spells that have the immediate potential to cause death or great harm. You also may not use nondamaging spells to incapacitate or weaken living foes so that your allies can kill them-if you incapacitate a foe, you must take him prisoner. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion or otherwise unwittingly, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell. (Characters who have taken a Vow of Peace are known to drink water through a strainer in order to avoid accidentally swallowing, and thereby causing harm to, a small insect.)

Vow of Purity	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Exalted	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sacred Vow														PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG				DESC:You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Fortitude saving throws to resist disease and death effects. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must avoid all contact with dead creatures, including meat cooked for food. You may not touch fallen foes. You may fight undead foes, but must purify yourself as soon as possible afterward.

If you fight undead creatures or accidentally touch dead flesh, you must purify yourself in a special ritual that requires 1 hour and a flask of holy water. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.
