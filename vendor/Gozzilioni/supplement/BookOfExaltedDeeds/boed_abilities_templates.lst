#Aleax Template																																
Searing Light	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AleaxRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per round, as a standard action, an aleax may fire rays of light from its eyes. The rays duplicate the effect of a searing light spell (caster level equals the aleax's Hit Dice).	KEY:Aleax ~ Searing Light																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
Shapechange	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AleaxRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An aleax can shapechange at will, as the spell. An aleax typically has one or two favored alternate forms reflective of the deity it serves. (For example, Bahamut's aleax has been known to take the form of a gold dragon.) The aleax retains its extraordinary and spell-like abilities regardless of the new form. Caster level 20th.	KEY:Aleax ~ Shapechange																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
Sudden Death	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AleaxRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If the aleax kills its intended victim, the victim's spirit is instantly transported to the aleax's deity, who gives the fallen character one last chance to barter for its life. The deity can demand a service, a sworn oath, a magic item or other precious item, or some similar sacrifice. If the character does not pay, his spirit is destroyed, and the character cannot be returned to life by any means. If the intended victim destroys the aleax in battle, the aleax and all of its equipment vanishes. However, some portion of the divine essence infusing the aleax merges with the character, who immediately gains the following benefits: a +2 bonus to Wisdom, a +1 insight bonus on all initiative checks, a +2 perfection bonus to AC, and spell resistance equal to the aleax's Hit Dice. The deity's wrath is annulled, and no more attacks will be made against that character for whatever offense begot the aleax (regardless of whether that character is now acting in an appropriate manner).	KEY:Aleax ~ Sudden Death																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
Singular Enemy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AleaxRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Although the aleax is visible to all, only its intended victim can harm it. Attacks made by other creatures are rebuffed, dealing no damage and hindering the aleax in no way.	KEY:Aleax ~ Singular Enemy																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
True Seeing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AleaxRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An aleax can use true seeing at will, as a free action. Caster level 20th.

#Sacred Watcher Template																																
Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SacredWatcherRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Every sacred watcher has this ability. A sacred watcher dwells on the Ethereal Plane and as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a sacred watcher manifests it partly enters the Material plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material plane. The manifested sacred watcher can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons or magic, with a 50%% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. The manifested sacred watcher can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. The manifested sacred watcher can always move silently.	KEY:Sacred Watcher ~ Manifestation																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
Positive Energy Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SacredWatcherRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A sacred watcher can make a hit with an incorporeal touch attack to infuse a target with positive energy. Undead foes (even incorporeal ones) take an additional 2d8+5 points of damage. The sacred watcher can channel this positive energy into living creatures as well, healing up to 2d8+5 points of damage. The sacred watcher can control its positive energy enough to avoid healing living foes (dealing only the base damage). This power can be used up to five times per day.	KEY:Sacred Watcher ~ Corrupting Touch																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
Rejuvenation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SacredWatcherRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a sacred watcher through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit often restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are often only temporary solutions. A sacred watcher that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its mission with a successful level check (1d20 + sacred watcher's level or HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to conclusively end a sacred watcher's existence is to ensure it fulfills the purpose that sustains it.	KEY:Sacred Watcher ~ Rejuvenation																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
Turn Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SacredWatcherRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A sacred watcher has +4 turn resistance.	KEY:Sacred Watcher ~ Turn Resistance									BONUS:VAR|TurnResistanceBonus|4																		SOURCEPAGE:BoED

She can move instantly to her ward's location as though using greater teleport, except that this ability allows her to cross planar boundaries. She can only transport herself and up to 50 pounds of ethereal objects. She can also scry on her ward at will (as though she had cast scrying), with no saving throw allowed and success guaranteed.	KEY:Sacred Watcher ~ Ward																											SOURCEPAGE:BoED
Skills	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SacredWatcherRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Sacred watchers receive a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks.
