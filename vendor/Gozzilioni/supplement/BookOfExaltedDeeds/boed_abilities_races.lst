Resolve a flying charge as normal. If the archon fails to damage its opponent, the discorporating dive attack is wasted. If damaged, however, the target must make a DC %1 Fortitude save. Those who succeed on the Fortitude save suffer no further effect beyond the damage of the attack. If the save fails, the attack utterly annihilates the victim's body, killing it instantly. Further, the victim's soul is bound to a great prison in the Seven Heavens of Celestia, where it remains until the archons that manage the celestial donjon see fit to release it. Release generally involves bartering with a throne archon (see Chapter 7: Celestial Paragons), with some quest for the cause of law and goodness being the most common price. Such agents of Heaven never release the soul of an unredeemed evil creature.|DiscorporatingDiveDC	KEY:Archon (Sword) ~ Discorporating Dive				DEFINE:DiscorporatingDiveDC|0					BONUS:VAR|DiscorporatingDiveDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|DiscorporatingDiveDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Discorporating Dive)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Discorporating Dive									SOURCEPAGE:BoED

In globe form, it can fly, use its dream rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and a tulani has no Strength score while in that form. While incorporeal, a tulani can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons (though its damage reduction still applies as well), and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50%% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). A tulani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the tulani revert to any particular form when killed.
