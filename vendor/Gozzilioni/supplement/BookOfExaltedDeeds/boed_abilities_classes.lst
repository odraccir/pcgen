Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Apostles of peace gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect them (such as a ring of protection or bracers of armor). An apostle of peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of peace spells or use any of his supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.	KEY:Apostole of Peace ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency																										SORTKEY:Class_Apostole_Of_Peace	SOURCEPAGE:BoED	
Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace has the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an apostle with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the apostle of peace's Wisdom modifier. When the apostle of peace gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 2nd-level spells for a 2nd- evel apostle), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The apostle of peace's spell list appears below. An apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does. To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace, add the character's apostle levels to one-half of his caster levels in other spellcasting classes.

An apostle can "lose" any prepared apostle spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

Pacifying Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic, using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target, such as fear or rage.

Censure Demon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils, and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a Charisma check for the apostle and consult Table 8-9 in the Player's Handbook, using the apostle's character level to determine the most powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6 + the apostle of peace's level + his Charisma modifier for censuring damage. Using both the apostle's character level and his class level in this manner means that he is more likely to affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle's holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle of peace attacks a censured fiend, the stunning ends immediately and the fiend can act normally on its next turn. If the apostle of peace's character level is at least twice the fiend's Hit Dice, he banishes the affected fiend back to its home plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. These attempts are separate from any attempts to turn undead.

See the Monster Manual for the unicorn's statistics. The unicorn appears instantly and serves the character for life, provided she remains chaste and of good alignment. The unicorn may be dismissed at any time, although a character cannot call another until she gains a level in the beloved of Valarian class. If the unicorn should die before its rider, the character may call another unicorn companion when she gains a new level in this class. A beloved of Valarian can have no more than one unicorn companion at any given time. A beloved of Valarian can assign her unicorn companion to undertake different types of tasks. Particularly useful as a mount, the unicorn typically will not undergo a quest or otherwise take on complex burdens without the supervision of the beloved of Valarian.

Ecstasy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ProfetOfErathaolClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day per class level, a prophet of Erathaol (%1/day) can enter an ecstatic state, allowing a celestial to seize control of her mind and speech. This is sort of a lesser version of channeling celestials (as described in Chapter 2), in which the prophet simply becomes helpless for 1 round while a celestial speaks through her. What the celestial says (and who it is) is entirely up to the DM, though it is always at least tangentially relevant to whatever matter is at hand. As a rule of thumb, this ability can have one of the indicated effects. Unfortunately, at the instant a prophet of Erathaol cedes control of her mind and invites a celestial to take it, she is vulnerable to possession by less beneficent spirits. If a fiend or ghost capable of possession is in ethereal form, within 30 feet of the prophet, and not flat-footed when a prophet enters her ecstasy, the creature can attempt to possess her immediately. The prophet takes a -2 penalty on her Will save to resist the possession, and if she fails she is not aware of the creature's presence in her body. The creature prevents a celestial from entering, and might pretend to be the celestial, speaking as the prophet's companions expect. If the creature chooses not to make its presence known in this way, it seems as though the ecstasy simply fails.

Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SlayerOfDomielClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a slayer of Domiel can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time a slayer's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the slayer's attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and an additional 1d6 at every two slayer levels thereafter (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). Should a slayer of Domiel score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a slayer of Domiel can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the sneak attack. A slayer of Domiel can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is  immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer of Domiel cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If a slayer of Domiel gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.

A strong aura of evil (an evil outsider or evil cleric of 5-10 HD, an evil elemental or undead of 10-21 HD, an evil creature of 25-54 HD, or an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of 10-21) can be detected at twice these ranges.

Specifically, the troubadour can learn and cast any spell described in Chapter 6 that has a celestial or eladrin component, as long as she can otherwise cast the spell (it appears on her spell list, it is of a level of spells that she can cast, and she has a sufficient ability score to cast spells of that level).

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.TroubadourOfStarsClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At each evennumbered troubadour of stars level, the character gains new spells per day and spells known as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. The class must spontaneously cast spells (as a sorcerer or bard does). She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bardic music abilities, improved familiar abilities, and so on). If the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class  before becoming a troubadour of stars, she must decide to which class she adds each troubadour level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Platinum Armor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vassal of Bahamut is granted the ability to create platinum scale mail. The vassal starts with scales from a slain juvenile (or older) red dragon and works them for 2 days per character level. During this time, the vassal must not engage in any other activities other than eating and sleeping. At the end of this period, the red dragon scales transform into glistening platinum scales. The finished masterwork suit of armor weighs 25 pounds and confers a +8 armor bonus. Its other properties are as a masterwork chain shirt (+4 max Dex bonus, -1 armor check penalty, 20%% arcane spell failure chance, no speed reduction). Only the vassal of Bahamut may wear the platinum armor, which instantly corrodes and turns to powder if donned by another creature. The vassal can replace a lost suit using scales from a slain juvenile (or older) red dragon, as noted above, but can craft no more than one such suit at a time. The vassal's platinum armor may be enhanced using standard item creation feats.	KEY:Vassal of Bahamut ~ Platinum Armor																										SORTKEY:Class_Vassal_Of_Bahamut	SOURCEPAGE:BoED

Shared Trove	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, a vassal of Bahamut receives a modest lump sum reward for his loyal service. The reward magically appears before the vassal-a mound of platinum coins delivered straight from Bahamut's celestial treasure vault. The number of platinum pieces equals 100 x the vassal of Bahamut's character level. The vassal may spend the money more or less as he sees fit, provided the expenditure serves a good or righteous cause. If the money is spent frivolously or unwisely, Bahamut sends a loyal representative (usually a gold dragon in an alternate form) to demand repayment. Spending the money to improve one's personal equipment is neither frivolous nor unwise.	KEY:Vassal of Bahamut ~ Shared Trove																										SORTKEY:Class_Vassal_Of_Bahamut	SOURCEPAGE:BoED	
Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a vassal of Bahamut gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the vassal must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a vassal with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Vassal of Bahamut bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the vassal's Wisdom bonus. When the vassal gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 2nd-level vassal of Bahamut), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell. The vassal of Bahamut's spell list appears below. A vassal of Bahamut prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Dragonwrack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.VassalOfBahamutClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Evil dragons that strike a vassal of Bahamut or are struck by him suffer grievous wounds. At 4th level, a vassal of Bahamut deals +2d6 points of damage with each successful melee attack made against an evil creature of the dragon type. Furthermore, any such creature that strikes the vassal with a natural weapon or melee weapon takes 1d6 points of damage. In both cases, half of the extra damage is permanent hit point drain. A dragon that survives a battle against a vassal of Bahamut often bears terrible scars from  the permanent drain of hit points. Only a wish or miracle spell can restore hit points drained permanently by a vassal's dragonwrack ability.  At 7th level, the vassal deals +3d6 points of damage to evil dragons, and a dragon that strikes the vassal takes 1d6 points of damage. Again, in both cases, half of this damage is permanent drain. At 10th level, the damage increases to +4d6 points and 2d6 points, respectively.

Bonus Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WonderworkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:For each level of wonderworker that a spellcasting character attains, he gains bonus spells to the number of spells per day he normally casts. These bonus spells can be added to whatever levels of spells the wonderworker can currently cast, but no more than one can be added to the character's highest current spell level. Arcane spellcasters (bards, sorcerers, and wizards) receive fewer bonus spells than divine spellcasters (clerics and druids), as shown on the table above. A psion who adopts the wonderworker class receives bonus power points/day equal to one-half of the sum of his psion level and his wonderworker level. A psychic warrior/wonderworker receives bonus power points/day equal to one-third of the sum of her psychic warrior level and her wonderworker level. If a wonderworker has two spellcasting or psionic classes already, he must give the bonus spell or power points to a class in which he can cast at least 3rd-level spells or manifest at least 3rd-level powers. If more than one class meets that requirement, he must choose which previous class gains the bonus. He cannot split bonus spells or power points between two different spellcasting or psionic classes. Once a wonderworker has chosen how to apply his bonus spells or power points, they cannot be shifted.
