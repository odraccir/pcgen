Fearsome Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodscaledFuryClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A bloodscaled fury is a terror to behold, and the seething fury that churns in its heart inspires terror in all who lay eyes on it. The dragon's frightful presence becomes more powerful: The saving throw DC to resist the ability is increased by the dragon's class level. Creatures with Hit Dice equal to or less than 1/2 the dragon's class level + 4 are panicked if they fail their saving throws, while creatures with more Hit Dice are shaken. Both fear effects last for 6d6 rounds (rather than the usual 4d6).

Draconic Fury	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodscaledFuryClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a bloodscaled fury's rage becomes more fearsome. While raging, its Strength and Constitution scores increase by an additional 2 points and it gains an additional +1 morale bonus on its Will saves. Thus, an 11th-level barbarian/2nd-level bloodscaled fury gains +8 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +4 on its Will saves. (Its Armor Class penalty remains at -2). At 6th level, and again at 10th, these bonuses increase by a similar amount. An 11th-level barbarian/10th-level bloodscaled fury gains +12 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +6 on its Will saves.

Scales of Blood	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodscaledFuryClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a bloodscaled fury earns its name. When it enters a rage, small quantities of blood ooze out around its scales, lining their edges and adding to the dragon's fearsome appearance. More important, the blood supernaturally wards the dragon from spells and weapon damage. For the duration of the dragon's rage, its spell resistance increases by its class level, and its damage reduction improves as well. The number before the slash in the dragon's damage reduction increases by 5 at 3rd level. In addition, at 7th level a bloodscaled fury's damage reduction can be overcome only by magic cold iron weapons, and at 11th level only by epic cold iron weapons. For example, an old white dragon with damage reduction 10/magic who reaches 3rd level as a bloodscaled fury gains damage reduction 15/magic while raging. At 7th level, it gains damage reduction 15/magic and cold iron while raging, and at 11th level it gains damage reduction 15/epic and cold iron while raging.

He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a barbarian with at least four levels of rogue, for example), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

Incite Rage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BloodscaledFuryClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 8th level, a bloodscaled fury gains the ability to incite rage in its allies whenever it enters a rage. The dragon can affect all willing allies within 60 feet, granting them a +4 morale bonus to Strength, a +4 morale bonus to Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to Armor Class for as long as the dragon remains raging. This ability is otherwise identical to normal barbarian rage, including the fatigue at the end of the rage.

Divine Conversion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DispassionateWatcherOfChronepsisClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, a dispassionate watcher loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously gained by virtue of its age and draconic variety. Its effective divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels it sacrificed. These effective levels apply only to the dragon's spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such as turning undead). For example, a very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric adopts the dispassionate watcher of Chronepsis prestige class. Its sorcerer caster level of 11th converts into eleven effective cleric levels, giving the dragon the spellcasting ability of a 12th-level cleric.

Calming Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DispassionateWatcherOfChronepsisClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, a dispassionate watcher loses its frightful presence ability (if it had one), gaining instead an infectious aura of calm detachment. This aura has the same radius and Will save DC as the dragon's frightful presence ability, if it had one. If it did not possess frightful presence, the radius is equal to 5 feet per 2 HD the dragon possesses (counting only its base dragon Hit Dice, not any class levels). The Will saving throw to resist the effect has a DC of 10 + 1/2 dragon's base HD + its Cha modifier. The effect of the aura is the same as that of a calm emotions spell, but it lasts as long as the dispassionate watcher does not attack.

Draconic Knowledge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DispassionateWatcherOfChronepsisClassFeatures	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A dispassionate watcher gains Draconic Knowledge (see page 69) as a bonus feat.

Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DispassionateWatcherOfChronepsisClassFeatures	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:From 2nd level on, when a new dispassionate watcher level is gained, the dragon gains new spells per day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. It does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (an improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essentially means that the dragon adds the level of dispassionate watcher to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a dispassionate watcher, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of dispassionate watcher for the purpose of determining spells per day. A very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level dispassionate watcher has the spellcasting ability of a 13thlevel cleric: 11 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to its effective divine spellcasting level. If the very old amethyst dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its spellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a 15th-level cleric.

If the target creature fails a Will saving throw (DC 10 + dispassionate watcher's class level + 1/2 its Cha modifier), it is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds.

Awesome Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DragonAscendantClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A dragon ascendant loses its innate frightful presence, replacing it with a special fear aura. This aura surrounds the dragon at any radius it chooses up to the extent of its frightful presence (30 feet X the dragon's age category), and is always active unless the dragon chooses to deactivate it. The dragon can choose to exclude its own allies from the effect of its aura. Creatures within the aura must make a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence DC plus 1/2 its dragon ascendant levels). Creatures that fail their saving throws are shaken, while those that succeed are immune to the effect of that dragon's aura for 24 hours. If the dragon attacks or charges, shaken creatures must attempt a second Will save (same DC) or become frightened. When a dragon ascendant reaches 5th level, it can choose to modify its aura to inspire resolve in its allies and dread in its enemies. All allies of the dragon within the radius of its aura receive a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and checks. The dragon's foes must succeed on a Will saving throw or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. When a dragon ascendant reaches 10th level, it gains a third option for its aura. The dragon can cause affected creatures to become dazed, simply staring at the dragon in fascinated awe, if they fail their Will saves. As with the fear aspect of the aura, the dragon can choose to exclude its allies from the effects of the aura. All uses of a dragon's awesome aura are mind-affecting effects.

The dragon breathes as normal, but in the wake of its breath the elemental appears, attacking in the next round. If it chooses, the dragon can instead summon an adult arrowhawk (air or cold), average salamander (fire), adult tojanida (water), or average xorn (earth). This ability works like the summon nature's ally V spell, with the dragon's class level as its caster level. A dragon with the cold subtype can summon a Medium water elemental or an adult tojanida. At 5th level, an elemental master can summon one Large elemental or two Medium elementals. This ability works like the summon nature's ally VI spell. At 8th level, an elemental master can summon one Huge elemental, two Large elementals, or four Medium elementals. Instead, the dragon can summon one elder arrowhawk, noble salamander, elder tojanida, or elder xorn, or four Medium creatures of the appropriate kind. This ability works like the summon nature's ally VII spell. At 11th level, an elemental master can summon one greater elemental, two Huge elementals, or four Large or Medium elementals.

Anything in the area takes 1d8 points of damage per class level of the dragon. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + dragon's class level + its Con modifier) reduces the damage by half.

The vortex extends from the dragon in an emanation with a radius of 5 feet per class level. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or if targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area. The storm deals 2 points of damage per class level to every unprotected creature within its area each round. The storm lasts for 1 round per class level (though the dragon can dismiss it as a move action), and counts as two uses of the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon cannot use its breath weapon (or its energy burst ability) while the storm is in place and for 2d4 rounds after it subsides.

This essentially means that the dragon adds the level of sacred warder to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a sacred warder, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of sacred warder for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Profane Blast	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.UnholyRavagerOfTiamatClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 7th level, an unholy ravager of Tiamat can unleash a narrow blast of raw profane energy from its mouth three times per day. The blast is a ray, requiring a ranged touch attack, with a range of 400 feet + 40 feet per class level. The blast looks and feels like energy of the same type as the dragon's breath weapon. If it hits a target, it deals the same number of dice worth of damage as the dragon's breath weapon, but uses d12s. (So, a great wyrm blue dragon would deal 24d12 points of damage with its profane blast.) The damage it deals results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy and similar magic. Each use of this ability counts as a use of the dragon's breath weapon, so it cannot use its breath weapon for 1d4 rounds after issuing a profane blast. An unholy ravager can target a creature behind a wall of force, prismatic wall, or prismatic sphere with its profane blast. The dragon makes a special dispel check, rolling 1d20 + its age category + its class level against a DC of 11 + the effect's caster level. If this check is successful, the effect is instantly negated (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed) and the ray goes on to strike the intended target (if the ranged touch attack roll is successful). A profane blast is stopped normally by a sacred warder of Bahamut's sacred shield.

Mass Profane Blast	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.UnholyRavagerOfTiamatClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 12th level, an unholy ravager of Tiamat's profane blast occupies the same area as its breath weapon and affects all creatures within that area. The dragon can choose whether to use a ray profane blast or a mass profane blast, and can use both abilities no more than a total of three times per day. If a wall of force or prismatic effect is within the area of a mass profane blast, the dragon makes a special dispel check as described above for each such effect within the area.

Sneak Attack (Dragon)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DragonstalkerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, if a dragonstalker catches a dragon when it is unable to defend itself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, any time the dragonstalker's target would be denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether it actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the dragonstalker's attack deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by 2d6 points every other level (4d6 at 4th level, 6d6 at 6th level, and so on). Should the dragonstalker score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the dragon is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a dragonstalker can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon to execute the sneak attack. A dragonstalker can only sneak attack living dragons with discernible anatomies. Any dragon immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the dragonstalker must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. A dragonstalker cannot sneak attack while striking at a dragon with concealment or by striking the limbs of a dragon whose vitals are beyond reach. If a dragonstalker gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack when the ability is used against dragons.
