Adroit Flyby Attack	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Flyby Attack	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hover,Wingover													PREMOVE:1,Fly=90				DESC:When flying and making an attack action, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that the total distance moved is not greater than your fly speed. Your flying movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the creatures you attack during the round when you use this feat.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Awaken Frightful Presence	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,CHA=11					PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon				DESC:You gain the frightful presence special ability with a radius in feet equal to 5 x 1/2 your racial Hit Dice. The ability takes effect automatically whenever you attack, charge, or fly overhead. Creatures within the radius are subject to the effect if they can see you and have fewer Hit Dice than your racial Hit Dice. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your racial HD + your Cha modifier) remains immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more Hit Dice become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.														BONUS:VAR|FrightfulPresenceDC|2|PREVARGTEQ:DragonAgeCategory,5			SOURCEPAGE:Drac

Clinging Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon									PRESTAT:1,CON=13									DESC:Your breath weapon has its normal effect, but also clings to anything caught in its area. A clinging breath weapon lasts for 1 round. In the round after you breathe, the clinging breath weapon deals half of the damage it dealt in the previous round. Creatures that avoid damage from the breath weapon (such as creatures with the evasion special quality or incorporeal creatures) do not take the extra damage. For example, an old silver dragon uses its cold breath and deals 72 points of cold damage (or 36 points against a target that makes its save). In the following round,  foes that failed their saves against the breath weapon initially take an additional 36 points of cold damage, and foes that succeeded on their saves take 18 points of cold damage. A foe can take a full-round action to attempt to remove the clinging breath weapon before taking any additional damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (same DC as your normal breath weapon) to remove the effect. Rolling around on the ground grants a +2 bonus on the saving throw, but leaves the foe prone. A clinging breath weapon cannot be removed or smothered by jumping into water. A clinging breath weapon can be magically dispelled (DC equal to your breath weapon save DC). This feat only works on a breath weapon that has instantaneous duration and that deals some kind of damage, such as energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), ability damage, or negative levels. When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac

You may make a special Draconic Knowledge check (d20 + your age category + your Int modifier) to see whether you know some relevant information about an item, event, or locale. This check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint about its general function. You may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of information is essentially random. If you have a Knowledge skill that is related to or applicable to the information you seek, you receive a +1 bonus on the draconic knowledge check for every 5 ranks you have in that Knowledge skill. The DM determines the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table below.

For example, an old silver dragon breathing an enlarged cone of cold produces a 75-foot cone instead of a 50-foot cone. Cone-shaped breath weapons get wider when they get longer, but lineshaped breath weapons do not. When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac

Creatures with multiple limbs qualify for this feat as well, so a creature with three arms and three claw attacks qualifies for this feat.

DESC:When you select this feat, you gain one spell slot per day of any level up to one level higher than the highest-level spell you can already cast in a particular class. For example, if you select this feat as a list-level wizard, you would gain one wizard spell slot of any spell level up to 10th. You must still have the requisite ability score (10 + spell level) in order to cast any spell stored in this slot. If you have a high enough ability modifier to gain one or more bonus spells for this spell level, you also gain the bonus spells for this spell level.

Large and in Charge	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																	PRESIZEGTEQ:L	PREREACHGTEQ:10				DESC:When you make a successful attack of opportunity against an opponent that is moving inside your threatened area, you can force the opponent back to the 5-foot space it was in before it provoked the attack of opportunity. After you hit with your attack of opportunity, make an opposed Strength check against your opponent. You gain a +4 bonus for each size category larger than your opponent you are, and an additional +1 bonus for every 5 points of damage you dealt with your attack of opportunity. If you win the opposed check, your opponent is pushed back 5 feet into the space it just left. An opponent you push cannot move any farther in this round.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Lingering Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Clinging Breath								PRESTAT:1,CON=15									DESC:Your breath weapon has its normal effects, but also remains as a lingering cloud of the same shape and size as the original breath weapon. This cloud lasts 1 round. Foes caught in the breath weapon's area when you breathe take no additional damage from the lingering breath weapon, provided they leave the cloud by the shortest available route on their next turn. Otherwise, anyone who touches or enters the cloud while it lasts takes one-half of the breath weapon's normal effects; any saving throw the breath weapon normally allows still applies. Damaging breath weapons deal one-half their normal damage, and breath weapons with effects that have durations last for half the normal time. If a creature is affected by the same nondamaging breath weapon twice, the effects do not stack. For example, an old silver dragon uses this feat on its cold breath weapon. Creatures caught in the 50-foot cone take 16d8 points of cold damage, and a DC 31 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The 50-foot cone lingers for 1 round. While the cone lasts, anyone touching or entering it takes 8d8 points of cold damage, and a DC 31 Reflex save reduces the cold damage to 4d8 points. Creatures in the cone when the dragon breathed take no additional damage if they leave by the shortest available route on their next turn. If the same dragon uses this feat on its paralyzing breath weapon, a creature caught in the 50-foot cone must make a DC 31 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6+8 rounds. The 50-foot cone lingers for 1 round. While the cone lasts, anyone touching or entering it must make a DC 31 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d3+4 rounds. Creatures in the cone when the dragon breathed take no additional damage if they leave by the shortest available route on their next turn. Creatures paralyzed by the initial breath cannot leave the cloud, but suffer no additional effects because the paralyzing effects do not stack. When you use this feat, add +2 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Maximize Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon									PRESTAT:1,CON=17									DESC:If you use your breath weapon as a full-round action, all variable, numeric effects of the attack are maximized. A maximized breath weapon deals maximum damage, lasts for the maximum time, or the like. For example, an old silver dragon using a maximized cold breath weapon (damage 16d8) deals 128 points of damage. An old silver dragon using a maximized paralysis gas breath weapon (duration 1d6+8 rounds) paralyzes creatures for 14 rounds if they fail their saving throws. The DCs for saving throws against your breath weapon are not affected. When you use this feat, add +3 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again. This feat stacks with the effects of breath weapons enhanced with other metabreath feats, but does not maximize them. For example, a maximized breath weapon further enhanced by the Tempest Breath feat produces the type of wind effect noted in that feat description, but the velocity of the wind is not also maximized.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Multisnatch	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Snatch									PRESTAT:1,STR=17									DESC:When grappling an opponent with only the part of your body that made the attack, you take only a -10 penalty on grapple checks to maintain the hold.

Overwhelming Critical	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	VISIBLE:YES			PREVARGTEQ:EpicCharacter,1	PREABILITY:5,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cleave,Great Cleave,Improved Critical,Power Attack,Weapon Focus									PRESTAT:1,STR=23									DESC:When using the weapon you have selected, you deal +1d6 points of extra damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add +2d6 points of extra damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add +3d6 points of extra damage instead (Creatures immune to critical hits can't be affected by this feat).

Power Dive	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,STR=15					PREMOVE:1,Fly=1	PREVARGTEQ:Maneuverability,3			DESC:When flying, you can dive and land on an opponent to deal extra damage. This is a standard action that can only affect creatures that are smaller than you. You make anoverrun attack, but the opponent cannot choose to avoid you. If you knock down the target, you may make an additional slam attack, dealing the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus (round down). This attack is at the usual +4 bonus against prone opponents.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Quicken Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon									PRESTAT:1,CON=19									DESC:Using your breath weapon is a free action.

Recover Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon									PRESTAT:1,CON=17									DESC:You reduce the interval between uses of your breath weapon. You wait 1 round less than usual before breathing again, but always at least 1 round. The feat stacks with the effects of metabreath feats, reducing the total time you must wait to use your breath weapon again by 1 round. Special:If you have multiple heads with breath weapons, all breath weapons use the reduced interval.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Rend	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack,Snatch													PREWEAPONPROF:2,Claw	PRESIZEGTEQ:H				DESC:If you strike the same opponent with two claw attacks, you automatically deal extra damage equal to that of two claw attacks plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. You cannot grab an opponent at the same time you rend that opponent.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Shape Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon									PRESTAT:1,CON=13					PRESIZELTEQ:S				DESC:If you have a line-shaped breath weapon, you can opt to shape it into a cone. Likewise, if you have a coneshaped breath weapon, you can shape it into a line. When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Shock Wave	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack									PRESTAT:1,STR=13				PRESIZEGTEQ:L	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon				DESC:You may, as a full-round action, strike a solid surface with your tail and create a shock wave that radiates out from your space and continues for a number of feet equal to 5 x your racial Hit Dice. Make a bull rush attack by rolling once regardless of how many creatures are in the radius. Every creature in the radius makes a Strength check and compares it to your roll. Those who fail their opposed checks are knocked down.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Snatch and Swallow	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Snatch,Improved Snatch									PRESTAT:1,CON=19				PRESIZEGTEQ:L	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon				DESC:If you begin your turn with an opponent held in your mouth, you can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If you succeed, your opponent takes bite damage and is swallowed. A swallowed creature is considered grappled, while you are not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light piercing or slashing weapon (the amount of damage required to get free is noted on the table below), or it can just try to escape the grapple. If the swallowed creature chooses the latter course, success puts it back in your mouth. Any damage a swallowed creature deals is deducted from your hit points. If a creature cuts itself free, muscular action closes the hole, so that if you swallow someone again, that creature must cut itself free again. Swallowed creatures take damage in each round they remain swallowed, as shown below.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Spellcasting Harrier	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	VISIBLE:YES			PREVARGTEQ:EpicCharacter,1	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes																		DESC:Any spellcaster you threaten in melee provokes an attack of opportunity if he or she tries to cast defensively. You get a +4 bonus on this attack roll.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Spreading Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shape Breath								PRESTAT:1,CON=15					PRESIZEGTEQ:S				DESC:You can modify your breath weapon so that it fills a spread centered on your head instead of taking its normal shape. The radius of the spread depends on your size, as shown below. When you use this feat, add +2 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Split Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shape Breath								PRESTAT:1,CON=13					PRESIZEGTEQ:S				DESC:Your breath weapon retains its size and shape, but splits into two areas that you aim separately. Each portion deals half the damage the breath weapon normally deals or lasts half as long as the effect normally lasts. For example, an old silver dragon that uses this feat on its cold breath weapon produces two 50-foot cones of cold that deal 8d8 points of cold damage each. If the same dragon used this feat on its paralyzing gas breath weapon, it would produce two cones of gas, each of which could paralyze a creature for 1d3+4 rounds. You can aim the split breath effects so that their areas overlap. Creatures caught in the area of overlap are struck by both weapons and are affected twice, subject to all the normal rules for stacking magical effects. When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac

When subjected to an attack based on that type of energy, you take one-quarter again as much (+25%%) damage, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac						
Tail Constrict	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Snatch,Improved Snatch														PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon				DESC:You can grab and constrict creatures you hit with your tail slap attack. This works just like a snatch attack, except that it can be used against any creature smaller than you. If you successfully grab an opponent with your tail, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to your tail slap damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. Each round you hold your opponent, you deal constriction damage. You cannot make tail slap or tail sweep attacks while constricting an opponent with your tail.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac

Tempest Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metabreath	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack								PRESTAT:1,STR=13					PRESIZEGTEQ:L				DESC:When you use your breath weapon, in addition to its normal effects, creatures in the area are affected as through struck by wind effects. The force of the wind depends on your size, as indicated below. For the effects of high winds, see Table 3-24 on page 95 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Because your breath weapon has an instantaneous duration, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6x5 feet). When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac

The wind blows from the center of your body toward the outside edge at the bottom of the cylinder. The force of the wind depends on your size, as indicated below. For the effects of high winds, see Table 3-24 on page 95 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Because the blast of air only lasts for your turn, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6x5 feet).																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac

Any damage you deal with your attack of opportunity applies as a bonus to the ensuing grapple check you make to avoid becoming grappled. This feat does not grant you an additional attack of opportunity in a round, so the feat does not help you if you have no attacks of opportunity available.																	SOURCEPAGE:Drac

This requires a Spot check against a DC equal to your target's Armor Class. If you succeed, your next attack against that target (which must be made no later than your next turn) ignores the target's armor bonus and natural armor bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor).
