The dracolich cannot cast other spells while this ability is in effect.	KEY:Dracolich ~ Control Undead																											SOURCEPAGE:Drac
Paralyzing Gaze	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DracolichRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The gaze of a dracolich's glowing eyes can paralyze victims within 40 feet who fail a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 dracolich's HD + dracolich's Cha modifier). If the saving throw is successful, the character is forever immune to the gaze of that particular dracolich. If it fails, the victim is paralyzed for 2d6 rounds.

# Ghostly Template																																
Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostlyRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghostly dragon dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghostly dragon manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghostly dragon can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50%% chance to ignore any damage from a corporealsource. A manifested ghostly dragon can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghostly dragon always moves silently. A manifested ghostly dragon can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon. A manifested ghostly dragon remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. The creature can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghostly dragon's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane. When a spellcasting ghostly dragon is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghostly dragon manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghostly dragon's touch spells don't work on nonethereal targets. A ghostly dragon has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.	KEY:Ghostly ~ Manifestation																											SOURCEPAGE:Drac
Breath Weapon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostlyRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Breath Weapon	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In addition to any breath weapons it had in life, a ghostly dragon gains a breath weapon that creates a cone-shaped cloud of gray mist. Any creature caught within is affected by a catastrophic ability drain, permanently losing a number of points of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution equal to the base dragon's age category (Fortitude negates). A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by this breath weapon from the same ghostly dragon for 24 hours (though it can be affected by the ghostly dragon's other breath weapons as normal). This breath weapon can be used once every 1d4 rounds and a maximum of three times per day.

Energy Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostlyRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:With a successful touch attack, a ghostly dragon bestows two negative levels on the target. A ghostly dragon does not bestow negative levels with any of its natural attacks (claws, bite, wing, tail, and so on).|EnergyDrainDC	KEY:Ghostly ~ Energy Drain	DESC:Fort DC %1.|EnergyDrainDC			DEFINE:EnergyDrainDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EnergyDrainDC|GhostlyAbilityDC	BONUS:VAR|EnergyDrainDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Energy Drain)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Energy Drain									SOURCEPAGE:Drac
Withering	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostlyRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghostly dragon's touch acts as a rod of withering, dealing 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage with a successful touch attack (Fortitude negates). If a ghostly dragon scores a critical hit, the damage is ability drain instead.

Rejuvenation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostlyRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghostly dragon through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghostly dragon that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghostly dragon for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research.	KEY:Ghostly ~ Rejuvenation																											SOURCEPAGE:Drac

# Vampiric Dragon Template
Blood Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampiricDragonRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampiric dragon can suck blood from a living victim one size category smaller than itself or larger. If it pins the foe with whom it is grappling, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained.	KEY:Vampiric Dragon ~ Blood Drain																											SOURCEPAGE:Drac			
Charm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampiricDragonRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The voice of a vampiric dragon can bewitch listeners. This requires a full-round action by the vampiric dragon, but any creatures within 30 feet per age category of the base dragon who can hear its voice must make a Will save or become charmed (as charm monster). The charm is immediately broken if the vampiric dragon uses its frightful presence within range of the charmed individual or makes any attack against the charmed individual. A vampiric dragon need not see its targets to use this power.	KEY:Vampiric Dragon ~ Charm																											SOURCEPAGE:Drac			
Create Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampiricDragonRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampiric dragon's energy drain attack rises as a vampire spawn (see page 253 of the Monster Manual) 1d4 days after death. If a vampiric dragon instead drains its victim's Constitution to 0, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or fewer Hit Dice and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampiric dragon that created it and remains enslaved until its master's death. An adult or older dragon slain by a vampiric dragon's blood drain returns as a vampiric dragon under the command of the vampiric dragon that created it, as noted above. Young adult or younger dragons slain by its blood drain attack, or any dragons slain by its energy drain attack, rise instead as mindless zombie dragons (see page 197).

Domination	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampiricDragonRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampiric dragon can crush an opponent's will just by looking into its eyes. This ability works similarly to a gaze attack, except that the vampiric dragon must use a standard action, and those merely looking at the creature are not affected. Anyone the vampiric dragon targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampiric dragon's influence as though by a dominate monster spell (caster level 18th). The ability has a range of 30 feet plus 10 feet per age category of the base dragon.

Fast Healing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampiricDragonRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampiric dragon heals 5 hit points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points or lower, a vampiric dragon automatically assumes gaseous form (fly speed 40 feet, otherwise as the spell) and attempts to escape. It must reach its hoard within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to 18 miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest upon its hoard, it rises to 1 hit point after 1 hour, then resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. For obvious reasons, a vampiric dragon prefers to keep its hoard well concealed from adventurers and would-be thieves.
