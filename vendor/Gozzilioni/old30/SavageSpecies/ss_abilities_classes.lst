Turn Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmancipatedSpawnClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An emancipated spawn gains an additional +2 turn resistance at each level. This stacks with any inherent turn resistance of the undead creature; for example, an emancipated ghoul at 1st level would benefit from a total turn resistance of +4 (+2 for being a ghoul and +2 for the prestige class).

Recall Feats	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmancipatedSpawnClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, an emancipated spawn remembers several aspects of her former existence. She regains all the feats she had as a living character, provided she meets their prerequisites. These remembered feats are in addition to any feats gained for advancing a level.

Recall Class Feature	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmancipatedSpawnClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, an emancipated spawn remembers more of her former existence. She now can use all the class features of one former class, as a character of that former class's level. If the former class was a spellcasting class, the emancipated spawn is able to cast one spell of each level available to the character (if she was a wizard, she must still consult her spellbook, or learn from scrolls if her spellbook was lost when she became a spawn). If the character had a familiar, the empathic link between her and the familiar is reestablished.

Rediscovery	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmancipatedSpawnClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, the emancipated spawn comes fully into her heritage. She recalls all her former class features and abilities, regains her former base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses gained from class levels, hit points, and all other class benefits, and can now advance again in any of her former classes. This applies even if a former character class does not normally allow free multiclassing, provided the character did not leave the path prior to her transformation into an undead spawn. Thus, a former paladin could continue to gain levels as a paladin (effectively multiclassing as a monster/paladin), but if she had left the path of paladinhood before her transformation, she is still ineligible to return to that class. In addition, a 3rd-level emancipated spawn receives the benefit of a sudden jump in ECL. If a character takes all three levels of the emancipated spawn prestige class, its ECL becomes the sum of its monster ECL + its three levels of emancipated spawn + the character's former class levels.

He permanently gains all of the creature's ranks in that skill (but not racial or ability score bonuses to the skill modifier) even if his new total is more ranks than the illithid savant's current character level would normally allow. This skill becomes a class skill for the illithid savant, and he may buy more ranks in the skill if the new ranks do not cause him to exceed his maximum ranks in the skill.

If the illithid savant already has spellcasting levels, these spells are in addition to those granted by the illithid savant's spellcasting class levels.

The chosen ability must not rely on a physical feature of the consumed creature, such as a gaze attack, a breath weapon, flight, or a natural attack with an appendage not possessed by the mind flayer.

Summon Swarm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterOfFliesClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A master of flies can use summon swarm as a sorcerer of her character level. She can use this ability once per day per level she has attained in this prestige class. The creatures summoned must be vermin; roll 1d20 on the following table.&nl;d20 Swarm Type&nl;1-6 Spiders (vermin, poisonous)&nl;7-13 Centipedes (vermin, poisonous)&nl;14-20 Flying beetles (vermin)	KEY:Master of Flies ~ Summon Swarm																		SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=MasterOfFliesLVL|CASTERLEVEL=MasterOfFliesLVL|Summon Swarm								SORTKEY:Class_Master_Of_Flies	SOURCEPAGE:SS30	
Swarm Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterOfFliesClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a master of flies can take the form of a swarm of vicious little vermin and return to her own form. This effect is similar to that of a summon swarm spell, except that the swarm is of the same size category as the caster (and it has the same face statistic as the caster). The master of flies can choose the type of vermin from the table above. In swarm shape, she can move at a speed of 15 feet, or up to 45 feet if the swarm flies (poor maneuverability). The swarm has the same number of hit points as the original creature and can be damaged by fire and area-effect spells and abilities. If the swarm is dispersed (by gust of wind, for example), the master of flies must return to her own shape. To do so, the dispersed creatures must first coalesce (at the swarm's speed); the master of flies must take a standard action on the following round to transform. A master of flies can use this ability once per day at 2nd level and more times per day at 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 9th level, as shown on Table 7-3: The Master of Flies. At 5th level, a master of flies is able to take the shape of a swarm identical to that produced by an insect plague spell, except that the swarm can be no more than one size larger than the master of flies (you can choose the face if more than one is available). This swarm can move at half the master of flies' normal speed and can fly at the same speed (clumsy maneuverability). At 8th level, a master of flies is able to take the shape of a swarm identical to that produced by a creeping doom spell, except that the swarm can be no more than two size categories larger than the master of flies (you can choose the face statistic if more than one is possible). This mass of vermin can only move at 10 feet per round and cannot fly. In all other respects, the swarm shape ability is identical to the druid's wild shape ability (see Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook).

Pied Piper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterOfFliesClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, a master of flies is able to influence vermin to a limited extent. She can use this ability once per day per level in this prestige class (%2) to charm a number of Hit Dice of vermin equal to or less than her character level, starting with the lowest Hit Dice vermin within range and moving up in Hit Dice until the limit is reached. The range of this effect is 10 feet x the master of flies' level. The vermin are allowed Will saves against this effect (DC %1), and any that make their save cannot be affected again by the pied piper ability of that master of flies for one day. Charmed vermin move toward the master of flies at their land speed, taking the most direct path available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, the creatures get another saving throw. Charmed vermin can take no actions other than to defend themselves. If the master of flies moves, the charmed vermin follow. This effect lasts for as long as the master of flies concentrates. Once concentration is broken, those vermin cannot be affected again by the pied piper ability of that master of flies for one day.|PiedPiperDC|PiedPiperTimes	KEY:Master of Flies ~ Pied Piper				DEFINE:PiedPiperDC|0	DEFINE:PiedPiperTimes|0				BONUS:VAR|PiedPiperDC|10+MasterOfFliesLVL+CHA	BONUS:VAR|PiedPiperDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Pied Piper)	BONUS:VAR|PiedPiperTimes|MasterOfFliesLVL							ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Pied Piper								SORTKEY:Class_Master_Of_Flies	SOURCEPAGE:SS30

Awaken Vermin	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterOfFliesClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 9th level, a master of flies gains the ability to awaken humanlike sentience in a vermin.

Swarm Leap	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MasterOfFliesClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 10th level, a master of flies becomes completely attuned to the throb and hum of vermin swarms, gaining the supernatural ability to instantaneously transport herself over great distances through that medium. Once per day as a standard action, she can enter any swarm of mundane vermin whose size equals or exceeds her own and travel to another such swarm in a single round, regardless of distance. The master of flies merely designates a distance and direction ("a swarm 50 miles south of here"), and the swarm leap ability transports her to a destination swarm as close as possible to the desired location. She can attempt to name a specific swarm ("a beehive in an apiary just outside the city of Greyhawk"), but if no such target exists, the ability fails and the master of flies is ejected from the entry swarm. Both the entry swarm and the destination swarm must be alive, but they can be either naturally occurring or summoned. A master of flies in swarm shape cannot use herself as the entry point, but she could enter through an insect plague she created in a previous round. She could even use another master of flies in swarm shape as the entry or destination swarm. When exiting a swarm, the master of flies must choose an adjacent 5-foot-by-5-foot space in which to appear (or a correspondingly larger space if it is larger than Medium-size). Except as noted here, this ability functions like the 6thlevel druid spell transport via plants.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ScaledHorrorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a scaled horror gains the ability to cast divine spells from the ranger spell list (see Chapter 11 of the Player 's Handbook). To cast a spell, the scaled horror must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a scaled horror with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Scaled horror bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the scaled horror's Wisdom bonus. When the scaled horror gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, the scaled horror gets only bonus spells. A scaled horror without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. A scaled horror prepares and casts spells just as a ranger does (though the scaled horror's caster level is the same as its class level).

The ability works only against opponents of the same size or smaller.

The egg gestates for one week before hatching into a slaad that eats his way out, killing the host. Twenty-four hours before the egg fully matures, the host falls extremely ill (-10 to all ability scores). A remove disease spell rids a host of the pellet, as does a successful Heal check (DC 20). If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. If the brooder is a blue slaad, the pellet hatches into a red slaad.
