Arcane Preparation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES											PRESPELLCAST:MEMORIZE=N											DESC:Each day,you are able to prepare one or more spells as a wizard does. If you are a sorcerer or a bard, this means that you can prepare a spell with a metamagic feat ahead of time, instead of cating it as a full-round action.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30					
Create Portal	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wondrous Item																		DESC:You can create any portal whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a portal takes one day for each 1000 gp in its base price. To craft a portal, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this base price. Se Chapter 2: Magic for details of portal creation. Some portals incur extra costs in material components or XP as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the portal's base price.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30					
Delay Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																		DESC:A delayed spell doesn't activate until 1 to 5 rounds after you finish casting it. You determine the delay when casting the spell, and it cannot be changed once set. The spell activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only area, personal, and touch spells may be affected by this feat. Any decision you would make about the spell, including attack rolls,designating targets or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the spell is cast. Any effects resolved by those affected by the spell, including the saving throws, are decided when the spell triggers. If conditions change between casting and effect in such a fashion as to make the spell impossible-for example, the target you designate leaves the spell's maximum range or area before it goes off-the spell fails. A delayed spell may be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target with spells such as detect magic. A delayed spell uses up a spell slot three levels highter than the spell's actual level.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30	ADDSPELLLEVEL:3				
Innate Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Quicken Spell,Silent Spell,Still Spell																		DESC:Choose a spell you can cast. You can now cast this spell at will as a spell-like ability, once per round without needing to prepare it. One spell slot eight levels higher than the innate spell is permanently used to power it. If the innate spell has an XP component, you pay the XP cost each time you use the spell-like ability. If the innate spell has a material component with negligible cost, you do not need the focus to use the spell-like ability. If the innate spell has a material component for which a gold piece value is given, you need that component to use the spell-like ability. Since an innate spell is a spell-like ability and not an actual spell, a cleric cannot convert it to a cure spell or an inflict spell, not canit be converted into a signature spell (see Signature Spell feat). Divine spellcasters who become unable to cast divine spells cannot use divine innate spells.

Inscribe Rune	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation	VISIBLE:YES			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=3										PRESTAT:1,INT=13									DESC:You can cast any divine spell you have prepared as a rune. The caster must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce the caster's XP total, he pasys the cost upon beginning the rine in addition to the XP cost for making the rine itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when he begins wrinting, but focuses are not. See the Rube Magic section in chapter 2:Magic for the details of runes and rune magic. A single object of Medium-size or smaller can hold only one rune. Larger objects can hold one rine per 25square feet (an area 5 feet square) of surface area. Runes cannot be placed on creatures. The rune has a base price of the spell level x caster level x 100gp (a 0-level spell counts as a 1/2 level). You must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half base price. A rune's market value equals its base price.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30					
Insidious Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																		DESC:When a Weave user employs a divination spell, spell-like ability or magic item (such as detect magic) that may detect the magical aura of one of your spells, the Weave user must make a level check (DC 11+your caster level) to successfully detect your spells. Similarly, a Weave user attempting to use a divination such as see invisibility to reveal the evffects of oneof your spells must make a level checl to reveal your spell's effects. The Weave user can check only once for each divination spell used, no matter how many of your spell effects are operating in an area. This benefit doesn't extend to spells you cast from the schools of Evocation or Transmutation. From now on, your ability to detect Weave magic is impaired. Any divination spell you use against a Weave effect is successful only if you make a level check against a DC of 9 + the caster's level. This penalty doesn't extend to Enchantment, Illusion or Necromancy effects (you detect them normally).																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30					
Magical Artisan	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=ItemCreation																		DESC:Each time you take this feat, choose one item creation feat you know. When determining your cost in XP and raw materials for creating items with this feat, multiply the base price by 75%%. Special: You may gain this feat myultiple times. Each time you take the feat it applies to a new item creation feat.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|FEAT|TYPE=ItemCreation														SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30					
Pernicious Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																		DESC:Your spells resist counterspell attempts by Weave users. When a Weave caster tries to counterpell a spell you are casting, he must make a level check (DC 11+your caster level) to succeed at the counterspell. This beneit does not extend to spells you cast from the school of Evocatio or Transmutation, not to opponents using dispel magic tyo counterspell (see Tenacious Magic feat later in this section). From now on you avility to counterspell Wave magic is impaired. When you attempt to counter a Wave spell, you must make a level check with a DC of 9 + your opponent's caster level to succeed. This penalty does not extend to Enchanting. Illusion, or Necromancy effects (you counterspell them normally). You may attempt counterspells with dispel magic normally.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30					
Persistent Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extend Spell																		DESC:A persistent spell has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent spell must have a personal ange or a fixed range (for example, comprehend languages or detect magic). Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can whose effects are discharged. You need not concentrate on spells such as adetect magic and detect thughts to be aware of the mere presence or absence of the thing detected but you must still concentrate to gain additional information as normal. Concentration on such a spell is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot frour levels highter than the spell's actual level.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30	ADDSPELLLEVEL:4				
Shadow Weave Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																		PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,WIS=13],[PREDEITY:1,Shar]				DESC:From now on, your spells tap the Shadow Weave instead the Wave. You also can activate magic items that use the Shadow Weave without taking damage. Add a +1 bonus to the DC for all saving throws of spells you cast from the schools of Enchantment, Illusion and Necromancy, and spells with the Darkness descriptor. You get a +1 bonus n caster level checks to overcome spell resistance for these schools and spells. The Shadow Weave proves less than optimal for effects inolving energy or matter. Your effective caster level for spells you cast from the schools of Evocation or Transmutation (except spells with the Darkness descriptor)is reduced by one. (First level Shadow Weave users cannot cast spells from these schools). The reduced caster level effects the spell's range, duration, damage and any other level-dependent variables the spell might have, including dispel checks against you. You can no longer cast spells with the light descriptor, no matter what your level us, Such spells automatically fail. Your ability to use magic items that produce light effects is also limited-you cannot invoke an item's light power if the item's activation method is spell trigger or spell completion. From now on, any magic item you create is a Shadow Weave item.

Signature Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Mastery																		DESC:Each time you take this feat, choose a spell you have mastered with Spell Mastery. You may now convert prepared arcane spells of that spell's level or higher into that signature spell, just as a good cleric spontaneously casts prepared spell as cure spells. Special: You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new mastered spell.

Spellcasting Prodigy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:For the purpose of determining bonus spells and the savbing throw DC of spells you cast, treat your primary spellcasting abbility score (Charisma for bards and sorcerer, Wisdom for divine spellcasters, Intelligence for wizards) as 2 points higher that its actual value. If you have more than one spellcasting class, the bonus applies to only one of those classes. Special you may only take this feat as a 1st-level character. If you take this feat more than once (for example, if you are a human or another type of creature that gets morethan one feat at 1st level), it applies to a different spellcasting class each time. You can take this feat even if you don't have any spellcasting classes yet.

Tenacious Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																		DESC:Your spells resist dispelling attempts by Weave users. When a Weave caster makes a dispel check to dispel one of your spells (including using dispel magic to counterspell a spell you are casting), the DC in 15 + your casterlevel. This benefit does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of Evocation or Transmutation. From now on your ability to dispel Weave magic is unpaired. When you make a dispel checl to dispel a Weave spells (or use dispel magic to counterspell an opponent's spell), the DC is 13 + the opponent's caster level. This penalty does not extend to Enchantment, Illusion or Necromancy effects, which you can dispel normally.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30					
Twin Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																		DESC:Casting a spell altered by this feat causes the spell to take effecttwice on the target, as if you were simultaneously casting the same spell two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the spell (such as targets, shaping an area, and so on) apply to both of the resulting spell. The target suffers all the effects of both spells individually and receives a saving throw for each. In some cases, failure of both of the target's saving throws results in redundant effects, sucg as a twinned charm person (see Combining Magical Effects, page 153 of the Player's Handbook), altought any ally or of the target would have to succeed at two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling (for example, using a untwinned frotm of the spell doen's negate just half of the twinned spell). A twinned spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.
