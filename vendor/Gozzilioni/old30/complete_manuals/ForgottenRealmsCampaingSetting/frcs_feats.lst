Only area, personal, and touch spells may be affected by this feat. Any decision you would make about the spell, including attack rolls,designating targets or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the spell is cast. Any effects resolved by those affected by the spell, including the saving throws, are decided when the spell triggers. If conditions change between casting and effect in such a fashion as to make the spell impossible-for example, the target you designate leaves the spell's maximum range or area before it goes off-the spell fails. A delayed spell may be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target with spells such as detect magic. A delayed spell uses up a spell slot three levels highter than the spell's actual level.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30	ADDSPELLLEVEL:3

If the innate spell has a material component with negligible cost, you do not need the focus to use the spell-like ability. If the innate spell has a material component for which a gold piece value is given, you need that component to use the spell-like ability. Since an innate spell is a spell-like ability and not an actual spell, a cleric cannot convert it to a cure spell or an inflict spell, not canit be converted into a signature spell (see Signature Spell feat). Divine spellcasters who become unable to cast divine spells cannot use divine innate spells.

The caster must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce the caster's XP total, he pasys the cost upon beginning the rine in addition to the XP cost for making the rine itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when he begins wrinting, but focuses are not. See the Rube Magic section in chapter 2:Magic for the details of runes and rune magic. A single object of Medium-size or smaller can hold only one rune. Larger objects can hold one rine per 25square feet (an area 5 feet square) of surface area. Runes cannot be placed on creatures. The rune has a base price of the spell level x caster level x 100gp (a 0-level spell counts as a 1/2 level). You must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half base price. A rune's market value equals its base price.																	SOURCEPAGE:FRCS30

Similarly, a Weave user attempting to use a divination such as see invisibility to reveal the evffects of oneof your spells must make a level checl to reveal your spell's effects. The Weave user can check only once for each divination spell used, no matter how many of your spell effects are operating in an area. This benefit doesn't extend to spells you cast from the schools of Evocation or Transmutation. From now on, your ability to detect Weave magic is impaired. Any divination spell you use against a Weave effect is successful only if you make a level check against a DC of 9 + the caster's level.

Your ability to use magic items that produce light effects is also limited-you cannot invoke an item's light power if the item's activation method is spell trigger or spell completion.

Twin Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																		DESC:Casting a spell altered by this feat causes the spell to take effecttwice on the target, as if you were simultaneously casting the same spell two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the spell (such as targets, shaping an area, and so on) apply to both of the resulting spell. The target suffers all the effects of both spells individually and receives a saving throw for each. In some cases, failure of both of the target's saving throws results in redundant effects, sucg as a twinned charm person (see Combining Magical Effects, page 153 of the Player's Handbook), altought any ally or of the target would have to succeed at two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling (for example, using a untwinned frotm of the spell doen's negate just half of the twinned spell). A twinned spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.
