The target suffers all the effects of both spells individually and receives a saving throw for each. In some cases, failure of both of the target's saving throws results in redundant effects, sucg as a twinned charm person (see Combining Magical Effects, page 153 of the Player's Handbook), altought any ally or of the target would have to succeed at two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling (for example, using a untwinned frotm of the spell doen's negate just half of the twinned spell). A twinned spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.
