#Magister template																																
Arcane Generosity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Magister is charged with promoting and increasing the use of magic in the world, and so whenever she gives away a magic item she created or teaches someone a new spell, she gains XP equal to 1/2 of the XP cost of that item (treat teaching a spell as giving away a scroll of that spell). This bonus is not awarded for items or spells that destroy or feed upon magic (such as dispel magic, energy transformation field, or Mordenkainen's disjunction). Many Magisters have created a legacy for themselves by leaving caches of spellbooks or magic items where people with the potential for great magic will find them.

Spell Purge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When the character becomes the Magister, all existing curses, charms, and other spells and effects placed upon her by other people are removed. The new Magister is also offered an immediate teleport to a safe place where she can remain undisturbed for up to a tenday, learning more about the duties of the Magister. A new Magister is protected by spell resistance 50 and a greater ironguard spell, although these protections fade after 1d4+3 months and nine days, respectively.

Magesight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Magister's connection to the Weave allows her to sense wild magic or dead magic areas, spellcasting, gates, portals, and ongoing spell effects within 60 feet. These are sensed automatically without concentration, and magesight operates even when the Magister is unconscious (awakening the Magister if something new enters the range of her magesight).

Spell Immunity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Magister is immune to one spell each of levels 0 through 9 as if protected by a spell immunity spell. The spells are chosen when the Magister takes office and cannot be changed thereafter. She is also immune to all forms of magical writing (such as glyph of warding, explosive runes, sepia snake sigil, and symbol), and her presence does not trigger their effects.	KEY:Magister ~ Spell Immunity																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Magister's Step	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Magister can step through any magical barrier of 6th level or lower as if it did not exist.

Spell Focus	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Magister casts all spells as if she had the Spell Focus feat for all schools.

Imbuement	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As imbue with spell ability, except that the Magister can imbue a target with any spell she has prepared (or knows, if a sorcerer). This ability permanently costs the Magister 1 hit point each time it is used.	KEY:Magister ~ Imbuement																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Name Attunement	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Magister can hear her name or the title of the Magister spoken anywhere in the world, plus the next nine words spoken after it. She also gains an idea of the direction and distance of the speaker. Treat this ability as a 9th-level divination effect.	KEY:Magister ~ Name Attunement																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Magister's Sigil	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Magister, like almost all powerful mages, has her own personal sigil, but can use the sigil of the Magister as well. Any other creature that writes the sigil of the Magister in a permanent manner (as opposed to tracing it in the air or on sand) must make two Will saves (DC 25 each) to negate a blindness and feeblemind (respectively) that last for ten days.	KEY:Magister ~ Magister's Sigil																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Rapid Preparation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagisterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The Magister only needs 10 minutes to prepare spells instead of an hour.	KEY:Magister ~ Rapid Preparation																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
																																
#Spectral Mage template																																
Paralysis	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpectralMageRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A creature touched by a spectral mage must make a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to the spectral mage's hit dice.

Corporeal Manipulation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpectralMageRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A spectral mage can manipulate material objects as a standard action. Its ability to manipulate objects is limited to what can be accomplished with a mage hand spell. This allows a spectral mage to use material components for spells and turn pages in its spellbook so it can prepare spells. The spectral mage needs to be in contact with the item to use this ability, so it must be touching the components it wishes to use in order to cast spells needing those components. This also allows the spectral mage to use magic items that do not need to be worn to function.	KEY:Spectal Mage ~ Corporeal Manipulation																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Item Link	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpectralMageRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A spectral mage has a magical link to the items it carried when it died. It can sense the exact location of these objects as a standard action. Most spectral mages search for and gather their material possessions, guarding them to a paranoid extent.	KEY:Spectal Mage ~ Item Link																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Madness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpectralMageRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Every time a spectral mage enters combat, it must attempt a Will saving throw (DC 15). If it fails, it goes mad 1d4 rounds later as the trauma of combat pushes it over the brink. This madness functions exactly like the confusion spell and lasts for 10 rounds.	KEY:Spectal Mage ~ Madness																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Turn Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpectralMageRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A spectral mage has +2 turn resistance.	KEY:Spectal Mage ~ Turn Resistance									BONUS:VAR|TurnResistanceBonus|2																		SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
Unnatural Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpectralMageRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a spectral mage at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.	KEY:Spectal Mage ~ Unnatural Aura																											SOURCEPAGE:MoF30
