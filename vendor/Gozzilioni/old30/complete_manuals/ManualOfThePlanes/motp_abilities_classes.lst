Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Divine agents are proficient with all simple weapons, and with all types of armor. Furthermore, a divine agent gains proficiency with her deity's favored weapon, if she does not already have it.

Spells per day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A divine agent continues training in magic as well as gaining power from her deity. At 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, the divine agent gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of divine agent to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a divine agent, she must decide to which class she adds each level of divine agent for the purposes of determining spells per day when she adds the new level.

Granted Domain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A divine agent gains access to one domain chosen from among those her deity offers, and with it the granted power of that domain. Divine agents who were once clerics essentially gain a third domain this way and can prepare their domain spells at each level from the new domain's list if they wish. No matter what their prior class was, divine agents gain the granted power of the domain they choose. In cases where the granted ability relies on cleric levels or allows turning or rebuking, use the sum of a character's cleric and divine  agent levels to determine the ability's effect.

Contact	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A divine agent of 2nd level or higher may be contacted mentally by her deity or its agents, usually to impart particular knowledge and orders to the divine agent. This contact only functions one way; the divine agent cannot initiate the contact, question the orders, or ask for clarifications. The nature of the contact depends on the deity: Dreams, ghostly visions, and illuminations from above are all possibilities. Contact from the deity rarely interrupts the divine agent's normal actions.	KEY:Divine Agent ~ Contact																										SORTKEY:Class_Divine_Agent	SOURCEPAGE:MotP30
Menacing Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, a divine agent gains the ability to generate an intangible, invisible aura of menace that weakens hostile creatures within a 20-foot radius. Anyone about to attack the divine agent must attempt a Will save (DC = the divine agent's character level). Those who fail the saving throw suffer a -2 morale penalty on attacks, checks, and saves for one full day or until they successfully damage the divine agent generating the aura. A creature that made its initial save or damaged the divine agent is immune to that divine agent's aura for one day.

Godly Gift	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels, the deity bestows on the divine agent a gift. Each deity's gift varies, but it is usually the ability to use a spell from one of the divine agent's domains as a spell-like ability. The deity offers a spell of the divine agent's level or lower. In other words, a 3rd- evel divine agent would gain one of her 1st-level, 2nd-level, or 3rd-level domain spells as a spell-like ability. The divine agent may use this ability once per day. The spell-like ability functions as a spell cast by a cleric of a level equal to the divine agent's character level.

Altered Appearance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, a divine agent begins to show prominent physical modification to match the desires of her deity. For good-aligned deities, this often takes the form of golden skin, hair, or eyes. Divine agents of evil-aligned deities might gain horns, antlers, or a pointed tail. Neutral deities may provide a copper or silver tone to the skin, while nature deities may cause a greenish pallor and barklike hair. Elemental powers may alter their divine agents' appearance by giving a texture to the skin reflecting the element involved. All such alterations are permanent, though disguise or spells may hide them.	KEY:Divine Agent ~ Altered Appearance																										SORTKEY:Class_Divine_Agent	SOURCEPAGE:MotP30

Mystic Union	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DivineAgentClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 9th level, a divine agent becomes a magical creature. She is treated as an outsider of the deity's home plane rather than as a humanoid. For instance, charm person does not affect her. Additionally, the divine agent gains damage reduction 20/+1. This damage reduction does not stack with other forms of damage reduction. Despite this outsider status, a divine agent may still be brought back from the dead if slain. The mystic union class feature grants 10 points of damage reduction bypassed by weapons aligned opposite the deity's alignment. For example, a divine agent of Kord would have damage reduction of 10/lawful or evil. Divine agents of completely neutral deities such as Obad-hai gain damage reduction of 15/magic instead.

Open Portal	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GatecrasherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, a gatecrasher's understanding of planar forces extends to the workings of magic portals, such that he may force them open without the correct device, spell, or key. The gatecrasher makes an Open Lock check using his Intelligence modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier. Portals typically have the following DCs:&nl;Portal DC&nl;Typical keyed portal 30&nl;Portal sealed by seal portal spell 20 + caster's level&nl;Portal created by deity 50&nl;Opening a portal takes 1 round of work and a successful check.

Summon Spell Dampening	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GatecrasherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Gatecrashers often aggravate demons and devils by inhibiting their ability to summon reinforcements. %1/day, a gatecrasher of 4th level or higher can create a dampening field that extends 100 feet in every direction. Summoning and calling spells and spell-like abilities are suppressed within this radius, though creatures summoned outside the dampening field can enter it normally. The dampening field lasts 10 rounds.

Planar Survival	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GatecrasherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level, a gatecrasher becomes attuned to the nature of the planes he visits and personally immune to their natural planar effects. Any effect that would be negated by the avoid planar effects spell is negated by the planar survival ability as well. The gatecrasher is immune to the "normal" fires of the Elemental Plane of Fire, but fire-based attack forms and unusually fiery areas there still affect him. Because this extraordinary ability is the result of attuning himself to a particular plane, the gatecrasher remains vulnerable to the same sort of damage in other planes where that attack form is not part of the natural order. Fires on other planes, including the Material Plane, affect him normally.	KEY:Gatecrasher ~ Planar Survival																										SORTKEY:Class_Gatecrasher	SOURCEPAGE:MotP30
Damage Reduction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GatecrasherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Gatecrasher of 7th level or higher has damage reduction 5/magic. This means that the character ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 5 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, by a spell, or by a form of energy (fire, cold, and so on). This ability does not stack with other damage reduction abilities.

Existing spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected; a gatecrasher can't end a foe's astral projection just by moving nearby. But spells cast after the gatecrasher emits the planar dampening field are affected: An opponent within 30 feet couldn't escape the gatecrasher with a dimension door spell or get reinforcements with a summon monster spell, for example. The gatecrasher can activate planar dampening %1 /day.

Favored Plane	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PlanarChampionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The planar champion has studied the natives of a particular plane extensively. She gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against a native of that plane. Likewise, the planar champion gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures native to the favored plane. The planar champion only gets the damage bonus with ranged weapons if the target is within 30 feet. The damage bonus does not apply to creatures immune to critical hits. The champion chooses only one favored plane, and even identical creatures from other planes are not affected. For example if a planar champion chooses the Nine Hells as her favored plane, she would gain the bonus against devils native to that plane, but not devils from the adjacent plane of Acheron. The planar champion's studies help in noncombat settings as well. The planar champion gets a +1 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when interacting with natives of the favored plane. Intuit  Direction checks get a +1 bonus when performed on the favored plane. The planar champion gains a second favored plane when reaching 5th level and a third favored plane when reaching  10th level. When gaining a new favored plane, the bonuses for previous favored planes increase by +1. The planar champion may not choose her native plane as a favored plane. The bonuses from this ability stack with the ranger's favored enemy ability. A ranger/planar champion with a favored enemy of devils and a favored plane of the Nine Hells adds both bonuses together when fighting a devil native to the Nine Hells.

On planes with the highly morphic trait (such as Limbo in the D&D cosmology) or the magically morphic trait (such as the Plane of Shadow), the terrain stabilizes around the planeshifter. The planeshifter automatically calms the terrain within a radius of 30 feet per planeshifter level. This area moves with the planeshifter and is centered on him.

Planar Area Swap	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PlaneshifterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 9th level, a planeshifter gains the ability to move sections of the landscape from one plane to another. A spherical area of up to a 100- oot radius per planeshifter level, centered on the planeshifter, may be so moved. Any unwilling individuals within the sphere can make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to negate the swap completely. As with the plane shift spell, fine control of the destination is impossible. When the fragment is brought onto the new plane, the traits of the new plane apply themselves within 1d4 rounds. A part of the Elemental Plane of Fire brought onto the Material Plane burns briefly (1d4 rounds), for example, then dissipates. Because it's a swap, an equal area of the destination plane appears in the plane of origination. The plane of origination applies its planar traits to the new area in 1d4 rounds. The swapped areas switch back in a number of days equal to 10 + planeshifter level.	KEY:Planeshifter ~ Planar Area Swap																										SORTKEY:Class_Planeshifter	SOURCEPAGE:MotP30
Demiplane Seed	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PlaneshifterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The demiplane seed is a small pocket dimension grown by a planeshifter who has reached 10th level. This pocket dimension is often used as a base of operation. A planeshifter can own only one demiplane at a time, and cannot construct a new one unless all portals to the old one are destroyed. The planeshifter must have a single flawless gemstone of at least 1,000 gp value and work on the demiplane for 100 consecutive days, for 8 hours per day. Upon completion of the work, the seed opens into a minuscule spherical demiplane, 1 foot in radius. It grows quickly, gaining 1 foot in radius per day up to a maximum radius of 10 feet x the planeshifter's highest caster level. After reaching that size, the demiplane continues to grow slowly, gaining 2 feet of radius per year. If its creator perishes, the demiplane stops growing. The planeshifter's demiplane has the following planar traits: normal time, alterable, and normal magic. At creation, the planeshifter can set whatever gravity trait, elemental traits, and alignment traits he likes, and can choose whether the plane is finite or self-contained. While the demiplane isn't morphic, the planeshifter has total control over the landscape at the moment of creation, so he can decide whether it will be a foreboding, mountainous wasteland or a bucolic forest. The terrain set at creation extends itself as the demiplane grows. While it's not possible to fit jagged peaks into a 1-foot sphere, cliffs and summits appears as the demiplane grows. The demiplane grown from the seed is unfurnished, so the planeshifter must provide what construction is necessary. It has a single portal entry, which the planeshifter may control for access. Demiplanes are often used as hiding places, research labs, and prisons for particular beasts.	KEY:Planeshifter ~ Demiplane Seed																										SORTKEY:Class_Planeshifter	SOURCEPAGE:MotP30
