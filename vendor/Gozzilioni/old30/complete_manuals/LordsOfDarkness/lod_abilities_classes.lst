Dark Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpurLordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Spur Lord is immune to any harmful spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that originates from the power of Cyric. Such effects act as if the Spur Lord is not included in their area. This includes spells waiting to be triggered (such as glyph of warding) but not magic items created by worshipers of Cyric. Whenever this ability is triggered, a brief manifestation of a skull surrounded by black flames appears above the Spur Lord's head.

Secret Blade	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpurLordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a Spur Lord has the ability to magically hide an item as if he were wearing a glove of storing. Only one item can be concealed at a time in this manner, although the Spur Lord can cause the item to reappear in either hand as a free action, regardless of which hand was used to store the item.

Dark Bflames	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpurLordClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Spur Lord of 3rd level or higher can invoke black flames of negative energy from his hands. The flames are a ranged touch attack with a range of 10 feet and deal 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the user (maximum 15d6). Undead are healed rather than damaged by this effect. A Spur Lord can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier	KEY:Spur Lord ~ Dark Flames	DESC:%1d%2|DarkFlamesDice|DarkFlamesDieSize			DEFINE:DarkFlamesDieSize|0	DEFINE:DarkFlamesDice|0				BONUS:VAR|DarkFlamesDice|min(SpurLordLVL,15)	BONUS:VAR|DarkFlamesDieSize|6|TYPE=Base																SORTKEY:Class_Spur_Lord	SOURCEPAGE:LoD30		
Cyric's Glory	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpurLordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability allows a Spur Lord of 4th level or higher to temporarily increase his presence and determination to phenomenal levels once per day. He gains +4 to Charisma and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. Cyric's glory lasts for a number of minutes equal to 1 + the character's (newly improved) Charisma modifier.

Flesh of the Prince	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpurLordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Usable once per day, this extreme manifestation of Cyric's power shows that the Spur Lord has reached the pinnacle of Cyric's favor. When it is invoked, his skin turns chalk-white and his eyes turn dark and blaze with infernal energy. In addition to all the abilities of the Cyric's glory ability, any weapon wielded by the Spur Lord becomes a +1flaming weapon, trailing dark flames (this does not increase the bonus of a weapon with an enhancement bonus, but does add the flaming ability if the weapon does not have it). The Spur Lord also gains a +2 natural armor bonus and a +2 deflection bonus to AC. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the character's (newly improved) Charisma modifier. When the power ends, the Spur Lord is fatigued until he is able to rest for 1 minute. Using this ability does not count toward his ability to call upon his Cyric's glory ability.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DarkmaskClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Darkmasks gain no proficiency in weapons, armor, or shields of any type.	KEY:Darkmask ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency																										SORTKEY:Class_Darkmask	SOURCEPAGE:LoD30		
Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DarkmaskClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A darkmask continues training in divine magic while practicing his secret skills. Thus, when a new darkmask level is gained, the character increases his spellcasting ability as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of rebuking or commanding undead, favored enemy, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of darkmask to the level of some other divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a darkmask, he must decide to which class he adds each level of darkmask for purposes of determining spellcasting when he adds the new level.

Dark Embrace	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DarkmaskClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A darkmask of 3rd level or higher has the ability to invoke dark embrace once per day, which manifests as a mask of shadow that girds the darkmask's face. The darkmask then casts a divine spell, which is absorbed by the mask of shadow; the spell must be a touch spell or a target spell. As a free action, the darkmask may command the mask to fly at a single creature within 100 feet, at which point that creature is affected by the absorbed spell (saving throws and spell resistance apply normally to the spell) and the dark embrace ends. The dark embrace can remain for 10 minutes. If it vanishes before its stored spell is unleashed, the spell is lost.

Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DarkmaskClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A darkmask of 3rd level or higher gains the sneak attack ability (as per the rogue class feature).

Cloak of Shadows	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DarkmaskClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A darkmask of 4th level or higher can create a cloak seemingly woven out of mundane shadows. The cloak provides a resistance bonus on saving throws and a profane bonus on Hide checks equal to +1 per class level of the darkmask. The cloak lasts 1 round per class level of the darkmask and can be created once per day.

Bladebend	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DarkmaskClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This defensive ability causes the weapon of a single creature attacking the darkmask to turn back and strike its wielder. The darkmask selects the target creature as a free action. If the target creature attacks the darkmask, it makes an attack roll as normal, but the attack is made against the target creature's AC, and if the attack succeeds, the target creature suffers the damage instead of the darkmask. This ability can be activated once per day and lasts 5 rounds. It only affects slashing and piercing weapons, and does not affect natural weapons of any kind.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ZhentarimSkymageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Zhentarim skymages gain no proficiency in weapons, armor, or shields of any type.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ZhentarimSkymageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A skymage continues training in magic while developing a bond with a flying monster and making political advances within the Black Network. Thus, when a new skymage level is gained, the character increases his spellcasting ability as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bardic knowledge, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of skymage to the level of some other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known (if appropriate), spells added to his spellbook, familiar abilities, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a skymage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of skymage for purposes of determining spellcasting when he adds the new level.

Bonus Scroll	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ZhentarimSkymageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At each level of Zhentarim skymage gained, the Zhentarim awards the character a scroll of two spells of any level he could cast. If the character has a spellbook, he may instead add these spells to his spellbook immediately at no cost or time spent.	KEY:Zhentarim Skymage ~ Bonus Scroll																										SORTKEY:Class_Zhentarim_Skymage	SOURCEPAGE:LoD30		
Flying Mount	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ZhentarimSkymageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Zhentarim skymage can call a flying monster to serve as his personal mount. The mount cannot have more Hit Dice than the Zhentarim skymage's class level + his Charisma modifier + 1. The mount serves the skymage loyally as if it were a druid's or ranger's animal companion, and carries the skymage into combat if desired (if the creature is strong enough to carry the skymage). Should a flying mount die, the character can replace it after gaining two levels in any spellcasting class. Necromancer skymages sometimes use undead monsters as mounts (including the animated corpse of a slain flying mount), and certain powerful conjurer skymages even have enslaved fiends as mounts. If the skymage suffers permanent Charisma damage or loses enough levels that he could no longer have his flying mount, the mount flees at the first opportunity, often attacking its former master before doing so.

Flying Feat	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ZhentarimSkymageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The skymage gains one of the following feats: Flyby Attack, Mounted Archery, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, or Trample. The skymage must meet all prerequisites for the feat before it can be selected. The Flyby Attack feat applies to the mount, not to the skymage, and cannot be used if the skymage is flying without a mount (such as with a fly spell).

Share Spell	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ZhentarimSkymageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The skymage can share spells with his flying mount as if the mount were his familiar. This ability only works if the skymage is riding the mount, and a shared spell ends for the mount instantly if the skymage is no longer riding it.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An entropist continues training in divine magic while attuning himself to the powers of entropy. Thus, when the character reaches 2nd level or 4th level in this class, he increases his spellcasting ability as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of rebuking or commanding undead, favored enemy, and so on). If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a entropist, she must decide when she reaches 2nd level or 4th level to which class she adds these spellcasting levels.

Control Sphere	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An entropist has the ability to control a sphere of annihilation as if he were using a talisman of the sphere.	KEY:Entropist ~ Control Sphere																										SORTKEY:Class_Entropist	SOURCEPAGE:LoD30		
Sanctity of Body	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An entropist is protected against spells or effects that would destroy or radically transform the shape of his body, such as disintegrate, implosion, petrification, or polymorph. These effects cannot affect the entropist unless he wishes them to. He is also unaffected by a sphere of annihilation, passing through it as if it were empty air. A hand of entropy or eye of entropy (see below) has no effect on him.	KEY:Entropist ~ Sanctity of Body																										SORTKEY:Class_Entropist	SOURCEPAGE:LoD30		
Arcane Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An entropist of 2nd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against arcane spells, whether they originate from the Weave or the Shadow Weave.	KEY:Entropist ~ Arcane Resistance																										SORTKEY:Class_Entropist	SOURCEPAGE:LoD30		
Hand of Entropy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:By expending an available spell slot, an entropist of 3rd level or higher channels the power of Entropy into a black haze around one hand. The hand of entropy can be used to make a melee touch attack as a standard action, and deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per level of the spell slot used to create it. The hand can be used on the round it is  created and lasts up to a number of rounds equal to the entropist's divine caster level. For example, a Clr7/Entropist3 could expend a prepared cure moderate wounds spell (2nd level) to create a hand of entropy that deals 1d6+2 points of damage and lasts 10 rounds. The hand otherwise functions like a touch spell. The entropist can use this ability multiple times per day as long as a spell slot is expended each time.

Arcane Disruption	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, an entropist of 4th level or higher can create a magical field of energy, which manifests as a slight smoky haze that interferes with the casting of arcane spells. The field is a 30-foot emanation centered on the entropist. Anyone attempting to cast arcane spells within the field must succeed at a Concentration check as if casting on the defensive (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the spell is lost. The field lasts for a number of rounds equal to the entropist's divine caster level.	KEY:Entropist ~ Arcane Disruption																										SORTKEY:Class_Entropist	SOURCEPAGE:LoD30		
Eye of Entropy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EntropistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, for a maximum of 5 rounds, an entropist of 5th level can create a miniature sphere of entropy. The eye of entropy is absolutely black, 2 inches in diameter, and can be moved up to 30 feet by the entropist as a standard action. Against objects, the eye deals 3d6 points of damage, bypassing the object's hardness. Against creatures, the entropist must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if successful the eye deals 3d6 points of damage to the target (Fortitude half, DC 12 + the entropist's Wis modifier); this bypasses damage reduction since it is a magical effect. The eye appears in the entropist's square when it is created, and can be moved and used to attack on the round it is formed. If the entropist stops concentrating on the eye, it vanishes.
