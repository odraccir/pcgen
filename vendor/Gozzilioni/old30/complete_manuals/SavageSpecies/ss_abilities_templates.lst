Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FeralTemplateTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a feral creature hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a Rake attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals Rake damage. See the Monster Manual for additional rules.

Detach	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SymbioticTemplateTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If the survival of a symbiotic creature is threatened, its two members can separate in an effort to save at least one of them (often this is the guest). This process deals 1d6 points of damage to the host. Detaching is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, which may be made against host or guest. A symbiotic creature may also separate to better bring to bear a host's or guest's special attacks. Reengaging is not a simple matter; it takes one day of complete rest.
