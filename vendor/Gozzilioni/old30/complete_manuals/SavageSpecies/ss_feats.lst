Everything within 60 feet is subject to the effect. Your final strike deals 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die, up to a maximum of 20d6. Each creature in the area may make a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modifier) to halve the damage dealt. The blast also has a secondary effect, which can be reduced or negated (as shown on the table below) by a second successful save of the type indicated (same DC_as the save against the primary damage). Special: A final strike renders your corpse unsuitable for raise dead or resurrection spells. Only true resurrection, miracle, or wish can restore life.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30

If you succeed, on your next action you can use an attack action to fling the held opponent. The range increment for the thrown creature is 120 feet. A creature may be thrown horizontally or vertically. If thrown vertically, it takes normal falling damage. If thrown horizontally, it takes damage as if it had fallen half the distance thrown (rounded down). For example, if a hurled orc is thrown horizontally 170 feet, it takes 8d6 points of damage. You may also fling the creature at another creature. To do so, make an attack roll at a -4 penalty, with appropriate range penalties, against the target creature. If you hit, both creatures take the amount of damage that the thrown creature would have taken otherwise, as given above.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Gape of the Serpent	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Swallow Whole																		DESC:You can swallow a creature of up to your own size category. Like a snake, you can stretch your mouth to an outlandish extent to accommodate immense prey. However, this process is time-consuming. If your second grapple check is successful after you have established a hold against a creature larger than you could swallow normally, you begin to swallow the held creature. On the following round, you must make an additional grapple check to complete the swallowing. The held creature can fight or try to break the grapple as normal while you are attempting to swallow it. Special: Your gullet can hold one creature of the maximum size; other maximum numbers of swallowed creatures remain the same.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30

All targets must be within your reach along the line of your movement. Make one attack roll, add the appropriate modifiers, and compare the result to the AC of each opponent you are attacking. If any hits are successful, make one damage roll and add the appropriate modifiers. Each successful hit does the full damage to that creature; do not divide the result of the damage roll among the targets. Targets of your attack do not get attacks of opportunity against you, but other opponents that would be entitled to attacks of opportunity may take them.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30

The effects of being panicked supersede the effects of being shaken.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30

When resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add 4 to your character level (monster Hit Dice plus class levels) to determine your Hit Dice for turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts. For example, a 4 HD wight with this feat is treated as an 8 HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts, even though it is a 4 HD creature for any other purpose.

If your concentration is interrupted during this simultaneous casting or spell-like ability use, whether by taking damage or by some other means, a Concentration check is required for each spell or spell-like ability. Failing either Concentration check negates both spells or spelllike abilities. You can also use one head to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while another head activates a head-based special attack, such as a breath weapon or an eye ray.

If you have two hands, your tail counts as a third hand for the purpose of the Multiweapon Fighting feat and all feats that use Multiweapon Fighting as a prerequisite. You can also use your tail as a "hand" to assist in grapple checks and Climb checks. You gain a +2 competence bonus on all such checks.

Quick Change	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,DEX=15		PRETEXT:Alternate form special quality.							DESC:The time it takes for you to change forms is reduced as follows (see table). This feat cannot reduce the time it takes to change forms to less than the time required for a free action.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Rapid Breath	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Quicken Spell,Quicken Spell Like Ability																	DESC:The required interval between uses of your breath weapon is reduced by 1 round. For instance, a dragon with this feat can use its breath weapon once every 1d4-1 rounds instead of every 1d4 rounds. If the 1d4-1 result is 0, the dragon can breathe again in the following round (but not twice in the same round). If the interval is a fixed period of time, such as once per hour, the interval is halved. Special: If you have multiple heads with breath weapons, all your breath weapons use the new interval.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Rending Constriction	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Constrict	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Improved Grab	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Greater Multigrab,Multigrab							PRESTAT:2,STR=19,DEX=15		PRETEXT:Two constricting limbs.							DESC:If you maintain a hold with more than one appendage on an opponent and are able to constrict, you can make an additional rend attack in the same round. This attack automatically deals double the base damage for a constrict attack, and the damage bonus is 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus. However, making this rend attack automatically releases the held creature on its next action. You must reestablish the hold to constrict again.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Reverberation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES															PRETEXT:Sonic special attack.							DESC:Add +2 to the DC of all saving throws against your sonic attack. Special: If you have more than one form of sonic attack, you can take this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different one of your sonic attacks.

Roll With It	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Toughness									PRESTAT:1,CON=20									DESC:You gain damage reduction 2/-. This applies in addition to any damage reduction you have from other sources. Damage reduction cannot reduce damage you take to less than 0. Special: You may take this feat multiple times.

Scramble	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Improved Evasion									PRESTAT:1,DEX=15						PRESIZELTEQ:S			DESC:The effects of this feat resemble those of the rogue's defensive roll, but you can use Scramble to avoid a potentially fatal attack entirely. Once per day, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), you can attempt to scramble out of the way. This requires a Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt). If the save is successful, you avoid the damage entirely. You must be aware of the attack and able to react to it; you cannot use Scramble if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Special: Since you cannot normally make a saving throw to avoid the damage from a blow, improved evasion does not apply. That is, you cannot save twice against the same attack.

Stamp	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Trample											PRETEXT:Feet.				PRESIZEGTEQ:H			DESC:You may, as a full-round action, strike a solid surface with one of your limbs and create a shock wave that radiates out from your position and continues for a number of feet equal to 5 x your base creature's Hit Dice. Make a single unarmed attack roll. Every creature in the affected area compares its Balance check result to your attack roll result. Those who fail this opposed check are knocked down. Special: Each structure and unattended object that is at least partially within the shock wave takes damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength bonus + the object's hardness (maximum 5).																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Supernatural Transformation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES															PRETEXT:Innate spell-like ability.							DESC:One of your innate spell-like abilities becomes a supernatural ability. It is no longer subject to spell resistance, though it can still be suppressed in an antimagic field. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The number of uses, if limited, does not change. The effective caster level equals your total Hit Dice or the effective caster level of the original ability, whichever is higher. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take it, it applies to a new spelllike ability.

Surrogate Spellcasting	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,WIS=13		PRETEXT:Nonhumanoid or Nonhumanoidlike form							DESC:You complete the verbal and somatic components of spells by substituting vocalizations and gestures appropriate to your shape. You must still have suitable appendages and vocal organs. For example, a giant eagle could substitute screeches and waves of its talons for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell. You can use any material component or focus that you can hold. This feat does not permit the use of magic items by a creature whose form could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak if you cannot already.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Swamp Stalker	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Background	VISIBLE:YES															PRETEXT:Marsh terrain.							DESC:You move easily through the sucking bogs and stagnant water of the swamps. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Swim checks and on Strength checks to break free of nets, webs, entangle spells, and similar hindrances. This feat does not grant a bonus on grapple checks.													BONUS:SKILL|Swim|2|TYPE=Competence				SOURCEPAGE:SS30

Thunderclap	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike,Power Attack									PRESTAT:1,STR=30									DESC:You may, as a full-round action, clap two of your limbs together and create a cone of sound that starts at your position and continues out for a number of feet equal to 5 x your Hit Dice. A storm giant using this feat creates a cone 95 feet (5 x 19 Hit Dice) long. Creatures in the cone get a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modifier) to resist the effect. Those who fail their save are deafened for the duration of the encounter. Those who fail their save by 5 or more are also knocked down. See the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide for the results of being deafened and knocked down. Special: This effect automatically extinguishes unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like).																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Treefriend	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Background	VISIBLE:YES															PRETEXT:Forest terrain.							DESC:You are completely at home in the forest. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost in the forest.

Uncanny Scent	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Scent	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Scent																	DESC:You can pinpoint the location of a scent when within 20 feet.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Vicious Wound	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise											PRETEXT:Wounding special attack.							DESC:When using an attack that has a wounding special ability, the wounds you cause bleed for an additional +1 point of damage each round. For instance, a hit from a barbazu's glaive causes the victim to bleed for 3 points of damage each round, not 2.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Virulent Poison	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Poison																		DESC:Add +2 to the DC for Fortitude saving throws against your poison attack.														BONUS:VAR|PoisonDC|2			SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Wingstorm	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hover,Power Attack									PRESTAT:1,STR=13		PREMOVE:1,Fly=20				PRESIZEGTEQ:L			DESC:As a full-round action, you can hover in place and use your wings to create a blast of air in a cylinder with a radius and maximum height based on your size. The wind strength also depends on your size, as shown on the table below. Because the blast of air only lasts for your turn, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6x5 feet). Special: You can use this feat for a full round instead of as a full-round action. If you do, the wind lasts until your next turn (and you can choose to continue the effect during your next turn). Anyone in or entering the cylinder is affected. Because you are producing a continuous blast of air, the checked effect works normally while the wind lasts (checked creatures cannot move forward against the force of the wind, or they are blown back 1d6x5 feet if airborne).																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30			
Winter's Child	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Background	VISIBLE:YES															PRETEXT:Cold terrain.							DESC:As an arctic dweller, you are more hardy. The DC of your Fortitude save to avoid subdual damage from cold is reduced to 10 (see Cold Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEONMASTER's Guide). In addition, you can make a saving throw each minute (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) to resist the effects of hypothermia in very cold water.																	SOURCEPAGE:SS30
