Summon Creature	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Abominations can summon creatures associated either with the portfolio of their godly progenitor or with their imprisonment. For example, an abomination whose deific father's portfolio included the sky might be able to summon air elementals, while another abomination sealed away deep in the earth might be able to summon earth elementals (regardless of its mother's or father's portfolio). Summoned creatures serve the abomination without question. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour, or sooner if slain. See specific abomination entries for additional details on summoning.	KEY:Abomination ~ Summon Creature																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH

Antimagic Field	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ColossusSubRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A colossus constantly generates an antimagic field in a 100-foot-radius. The field is an invisible barrier that is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines, except for the colossus's own supernatural abilities. This effect is otherwise as an antimagic field cast by a 25th-level caster.	KEY:Colossus ~ Antimagic Field																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH

Negative Energy Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationAtropalRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 30-foot-radius spread negative energy aura spreads from each atropal. All undead in the field (including the atropal) are treated as if having turn resistance +20 and a negative energy version of fast healing 20. Living creatures in the aura are treated as having ten negative levels unless they have some sort of negative energy protection or protection from evil. Creatures with 10 or fewer HD or levels perish (and, at the atropals option, rise as spectres under the atropals command 1 minute later).

For each negative level bestowed on an opponent, the atropal heals 10 points of damage, or 20 on a critical hit, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. After 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must attempt a Fortitude save (DC %1) for each negative level. If successful, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature; otherwise, the creature's level decreases by one. The temporary hit points gained by the atropal's Constitution drain last a maximum of 1 hour.| EnergyDrainDC	KEY:Abomination (Atropal) ~ Energy Drain				DEFINE:EnergyDrainDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EnergyDrainDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|EnergyDrainDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Energy Drain)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Energy Drain									SOURCEPAGE:ELH

The chichimec heals 10 points of damage, or 20 on critical hit, whenever it drains Charisma, gaining any excess as temporary points. The attack allows a Fortitude save (DC %1) - on a successful save, only 1 point of Charisma is drained and the chichimec heals 5 points of damage.

Worst Nightmare	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationDreamLarvaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Each time a living creature first views a specific dream larva from a distance of 30 feet or less (or from a scrying effect), the subject sees the image of the most fearsome creature imaginable. This is not an illusion or phantasm; the dream larva truly becomes, for just that instant, the subject's worst nightmare. Even if simultaneously viewed by dozens of different creatures, the dream larva appears differently to each one of them. Creatures immune to fear or mind-affecting effects (or warded by protection from evil or death ward spells) are immune to worst nightmare; all others must make a Will save (DC %1) or die from the supernatural horror revealed. Survivors (and those resurrected) are immune to the effect from that individual dream larva in the future.|WorstNightmareDC	KEY:Abomination (Dream Larva) ~ Worst Nightmare				DEFINE:WorstNightmareDC|0					BONUS:VAR|WorstNightmareDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|WorstNightmareDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Worst Nightmare)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Worst Nightmare									SOURCEPAGE:ELH

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationDreamLarvaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If the dream larva hits with a claw or pincer, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Dream larvae can use improved grab on a creature of any size. The dream larva has the option to conduct the grapple normally, simply use the claw or pincer to hold the opponent, or use sending (see below) on the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage listed for the attack that established the hold, unless it used sending on the victim.	KEY:Abomination (Dream Larva) ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Sending	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationDreamLarvaRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Grappled victims may be physicaly sent into a nightmare, at the dream larva's option, on the dream larva's next action after establishing the grapple. Victims must make a Will save (DC %1) or be apparently swarmed by thousands of worms making up the dream larva's body. The victim is actually cast into a shrieking maelstrom of dream where it can take no actions but observe. The victim physically returns 2d4 rounds later, apparently ejected from the dream larva's body (but appearing even if the dream larva has left or is otherwise absent). The victim of the nightmare has taken 4d6 points of temporary Wisdom damage, but is otherwise free to act on the round it returns. If the victim takes more Wisdom damage than it has points of Wisdom, the extra points are instead treated as temporary Constitution damage.|SendingDC	KEY:Abomination (Dream Larva) ~ Sending				DEFINE:SendingDC|0					BONUS:VAR|SendingDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|SendingDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Sending)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Sending									SOURCEPAGE:ELH

The hecatoncheires does not suffer an attack or damage penalty for attacking with one hundred weapons. However, the press of limbs prevents the creature from making iterative attacks with any of its arms, nor can it make more than ten attacks against a Small or smaller creature, fifteen attacks against a Medium-size creature, or twenty attacks against a Large creature in the same action (it can make all its attacks against a Huge or larger creature in one action).

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationInfernalRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an infernal hits with a claw, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Infernals can use this ability on Large and smaller creatures. The infernal has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its claw to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals standard claw damage, in addition to automatic spell suck damage.	KEY:Abomination (Infernal) ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Spell Suck	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationInfernalRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an infernal bites a foe, the foe loses one of its highestlevel prepared spells or one of the spell slots for this day that it has not used. The victim chooses the prepared spell to lose. If the victim has no prepared spells or unused spell slots (either because it has exhausted its spellcasting for the day or because the victim is not a spellcaster), the bite instead deals 2 points of temporary Intelligence damage.

Learned Spell Immunity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationInfernalRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an infernal is affected by a spell cast by a particular spellcaster, the infernal thereafter becomes immune to that spell when cast by that spellcaster. For instance, if the infernal is hit by Mialee's horrid wilting and is affected, it then becomes immune to horrid wilting if cast by Mialee ever again, though if Hennet casts horrid wilting on the infernal, it is subject to the spell's effects (the first time).

Time Leach	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationPhaneRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:For every round of apparent time experienced by the phane, it automatically absorbs the "future" from any creature it has successfully incapsulated in static time via its stasis touch (not its null time field), no matter the distance separating victim and phane, and no matter the number of victims. Of course, to the victim no time passes at all, but each apparent round experienced by the phane ages the victim 1d4 years, at the same time healing the phane of 20 hit points of damage. A victim who is not somehow released from static time by a friend who can cast dispel magic, greater dispelling, or some other likely spell, eventually ages to death. Victims killed in this manner automatically fall out of static time as desiccated husks that disintegrate to a fine dust with even the lightest touch. Victims who are released prior to death immediately apply the physical effects of aging, but not the mental effects (see Table 6-5: Aging Effects in the Player's Handbook).	KEY:Abomination (Phane) ~ Time Leach																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Summon Past Time Duplicate	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationPhaneRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a phane can summon a duplicate of one its foes stolen from a parallel alternate past. The stolen time duplicate has the same stats and possessions as the original, but is treated as if having two negative levels (which simulates a less experienced version of the original). The phane can never summon a past time duplicate of a creature with more than 25 HD (add sufficient negative levels to compensate for high foe HD, if necessary). The past time duplicate, despite having most of the knowledge of the original, serves the phane loyally like any summoned creature. If the past time duplicate is slain, the original is not harmed because the duplicate was pulled from a parallel past. However, the original does not necessarily realize this, and must make a Will save (DC %1) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds after witnessing the death of a duplicate for the first time.|SummonPastTimeDuplicateDC	KEY:Abomination (Phane) ~ Summon Past Time Duplicate				DEFINE:SummonPastTimeDuplicateDC|0					BONUS:VAR|SummonPastTimeDuplicateDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|SummonPastTimeDuplicateDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Summon Past Time Duplicate)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Summon Past Time Duplicate									SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Null Time Field	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbominationPhaneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Phanes continually generate a 30-foot-radius spread null time field. All creatures and objects in the field, except the phane, must make a Will saving throw (DC %1) each round to take any actions.

Once it has a slave, it cannot enslave another until its current slave dies, is imprisoned, or is otherwise taken out of the picture. A slave becomes free if its genius loci master is slain. A genius loci forces its slave to remain with it, though it may send its slave off to temporarily visit nearby locations in order to draw in unsuspecting victims. In fact, the "purposes" of the genius loci are to some degree influenced by the current slave. The genius loci has no Intelligence score of its own; thus, its emuliation of its slave's intelligence sometimes transfers attitudes and goals. However, a slave can only go so far in influencing its hardly mobile master, and cannot knowingly attempt to free itself from the genius loci that keeps it close.|EnslaveDC	KEY:Genius Loci ~ Enslave				DEFINE:EnslaveDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EnslaveDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|EnslaveDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Enslave)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Enslave									SOURCEPAGE:ELH

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GibberingOrbRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A gibbering orb can attempt to swallow a Large or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 4d8 points of constriction damage plus 3d10 points of acid damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 20 points of damage in a single blow (AC 16, DR 25/+6 still applies). Once the creature exits, the fluidlike body structure of the orb closes the wound; other swallowed opponents must cut their own way out. When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see below) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.	KEY:Gibbering Orb ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH

The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around in body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 feet. Each of these effects functions as a ray (see Aiming a Spell in Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook), regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of death, flesh lo stone, greater dispelling, harm, hold monster, horrid wilting, implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic missile, Mordenkainen's disjunction, Otto's irresistible dance, polymorph any object, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray, slay living, and temporal stasis.

Alter Shape	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HagunemnonRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A protean can assume the shape of any combination of physical nondeific creatures at the same time as a free action. In fact, a proteans form constantly boils, and it requires a move-equivalent action each round for a protean to maintain a certain shape (even if that shape is a combination of several shapes). Whatever its present form, the protean retains all its own special qualities. Plus, it gains the advantage of up to four extraordinary abilities from the forms it mimics (but not spell-like or supernatural powers). The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension (make sure to take into account rules for reach and size modifiers to AC and melee attacks). Incorporeal traits can also be assumed, which counts as a single extraordinary ability. If a hagunemnon assumes a partial form that confers an extraordinary ability already possessed by the creature, only the better of the two abilities is retained. No matter its form, the protean can never make more than five attacks using a full-round action. However, it may  substitute a melee attack form for one of its slam attacks, using its own base attack bonus and Strength modifier to damage, but dealing base damage appropriate to the attack type. For instance, if the protean gives itself the head of a  dragon, it gives up one of its slam attacks for a bite attack, while retaining four other slam attacks, or some other combination of melee attacks that do not exceed four.

The living vault can hold two Gargantuan creatures, eight Huge creatures, thirty-two Large creatures, one hundred twentyeight Medium-size creatures, and so on. This assumes that the rest of the vault is also relatively empty, so a large hoard of treasure reduces the number of creatures a living vault can hold at any one time. If freedom is later cast upon the very spot where the victim of imprisonment disappeared, the victim is freed, though it doesn't appear where it disappeared, but in a space adjacent to wherever the living vault is currently physically located.|ImprisonmentDC	KEY:Living Vault ~ Imprisonment				DEFINE:ImprisonmentDC|0					BONUS:VAR|ImprisonmentDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|ImprisonmentDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Imprisonment)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Imprisonment									SOURCEPAGE:ELH

When in safekeeping mode, the living vault responds to a sending by its master, returning to the location from which it left and becoming tangible once again. Creatures and objects that are stored within the vault are treated as if under the effects of sequester, whether the vault itself is or not. Often, creatures are brought into the vault via imprisonment, but sometimes unconscious or otherwise subdued creatures are stored as an object, in which case they receive no saving throw to resist the effect.

Improved grab works only against Gargantuan and smaller opponents. The mu spore has the option to conduct the grapple normally, transfer the victim to its mouth as a free action, or simply use its tendril to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage given for the tendril.	KEY:Mu Spore ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MuSporeRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Swallow Whole	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If the mu spore begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth, it can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey and the opponent takes bite damage. A swallowed creature takes the twice the damage given for the mu spore's bite every round. A swallowed creature is considered grappled, while the creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light piercing or slashing weapon, if it can deal 33 points of damage in this fashion, or it can just try to escape the grapple. If the swallowed creature choose the latter course, success puts it back in the mu spores mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

Any creature that touches or successfully attacks a mu spore with a melee weapon is subject to a free improved grab check by the mu spore, as if the mu spore had successfully attacked the creature with a tendril. A creature wielding a melee weapon must immediately relinquish its grip on its weapon, or proceed with the grapple check. If the subject relinquishes its grip on its weapon, the weapon is swallowed the following round. Creatures who attack the mu spore in melee without a weapon they can release (such as those with natural attacks only, do not have this option).

Head-Tentacles	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NehThalgguRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The long, whiplike tentacles that frame either side of a brain collector's face can deliver a dangerous touch attack that, if successful, causes the target to dehydrate and wither (2d10 points of desiccation damage). In addition, each successful tentacle attack drains 1 point of Strength, 1 point of Dexterity, and 1 point of Constitution. This is permanent ability drain and may only be reversed by spells such as restoration and greater restoration. Typically, the neh-thalggu uses this attack to immobilize a target preparatory to extracting its brain. It can bring all ten tentacles to bear on a single target facing it or divide its attacks against up to ten targets that it threatens.	KEY:Neh-Thalggu ~ Head-Tentacles																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Extract Brains	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NehThalgguRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once every 1d4 rounds, as a fullround action, a brain collector can extract the brain from a target creature in line of sight. This attack is psionic in nature and can be blocked by a dimensional anchor currently in force on the target. The target gets a Will save (DC %1) to resist the extraction. If the save fails, his or her brain is drawn out intact through the skull by extradimensional means and sucked up by the brain collector, lodging in an unused storage sac above and behind its eyes. If the save succeeds, he or she takes 9d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A brain collector prefers to absorb brains of high-level arcane spellcasters but is fully capable of extracting those of other foes as a highly effective attack. When encountered, assume a neh-thalggu has a full retinue of thirteen stolen brains. Each brain less than the full thirteen bestows one negative level on the nehthalggu (though these never convert to actual level loss), which is a powerful incentive for the creature to always keep its brain-sacs filled. A  neh-thalggu is free to draw on all the Knowledge skills of each brain it currently stores, using the base ranks in a skill possessed by each brain, and adjusted by the neh-thalggu's own skill modifiers for the Knowledge skill in question (or its Intelligence modifier, for a skill it has no ranks in).|ExtractBrainsDC	KEY:Neh-Thalggu ~ Extract Brains				DEFINE:ExtractBrainsDC|0					BONUS:VAR|ExtractBrainsDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|ExtractBrainsDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Extract Brains)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Extract Brains									SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Dimensional Travel	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NehThalgguRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A brain collector can move with surprising speed for something of its ungainly bulk, but its preferred method of locomotion is via dimension door, which it can do as a quickened action, once per round. It can also use teleport without error or plane shift at will as a move-equivalent action. A nehthalggu likes to combine dimension door with Spring Attack to get behind foes' defenses and take them unawares from a different direction each round.

In addition, any creature within 20 feet of the prismasaurus is randomly struck by one or more rays of light, as determined by the table that accompanies the prismatic spray spell in the Player's Handbook.

Cocoon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ThorciasidRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A thorciasid can eject a stream of noxious goo that hardens on contact, potentially fixing a subject in place and hindering its movement and actions. Using a standard action, the thorciasid makes a ranged touch attack against any foe it can see up to 60 feet away. If it succeeds at the ranged touch attack, the subject makes a grapple check against the cocoon. This is accomplished as if the thorciasid itself were making the grapple check with a competence bonus of +10, for a total check modifier of +37. On a failed check for the subject, the goo hardens into a partial cocoon, and the victim is treated as if grappled (even though the thorciasid is free to do as it desires). The subject can attempt to break the grapple of the cocoon (or use Escape Artist) each round, making an opposed grapple check against the cocoon (check modifier +37 for the cocoon). A thorciasid can reinforce a partial cocoon by spending a standard action secreting additional goo. Each action so spent provides an additional +5 to the cocoon's grapple check modifier. Visually, the victim becomes more and more covered and is finally completely encased in a cocoon. Even fully encased victims can still breathe, and a thorciasid can drain a victim's life force at its leisure.	KEY:Thorciasid ~ Cocoon																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH

The negative levels similarly last for 24 hours, at which time the victim must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1) to avoid level loss.

Those who make a successful saving throw still take 5d6 points of damage from the disintegrating touch. Likewise, weapons or objects that save take a like amount of damage.

Vortex	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UmbralBlotRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Sometimes an umbral blot finds a particularly agile and speedy target eluding its touch. In such cases, it generally resorts to its vortex attack. Normally a blackball insulates itself somehow from the air around it (otherwise it would perpetually be at the center of a howling windstorm). If it chooses, instead of allowing the air to bend around it, the blackball can suspend this insulation, causing a sudden rush of wind to pour toward the blackball from all directions. This vortex sucks all the air from a 30-foot-by-30-foot-by-30-foot room in a single round, creating a sudden influx of air in its direction. All flying or floating creatures within 30 feet of the umbral blot who fail a Reflex save (DC %1) are swept along with the wind into contact with the blackball. Nonflying creatures within 30 feet who fail a Reflex save (DC 19) are pulled into contact with the umbral blot. Contact with an umbral blot could lead to disintegration, as noted above.|VortexDC	KEY:Umbral Blot ~ Vortex				DEFINE:VortexDC|0					BONUS:VAR|VortexDC|DefaultDCStr	BONUS:VAR|VortexDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Vortex)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Vortex									SOURCEPAGE:ELH
