It is sometimes referred to as the Order of the Seal (due to a strange relic the group keeps sealed below its headquarters in the city of Union's Commerce Quarter). Its members work as bodyguards for anyone with the wealth to pay them, but they are good enough to serve heads of state.	PREALIGN:LG,LN,NG,TN,CG,CN																												SOURCEPAGE:ELH
