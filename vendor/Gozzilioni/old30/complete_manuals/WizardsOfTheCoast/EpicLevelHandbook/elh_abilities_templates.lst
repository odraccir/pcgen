# Demilich Template																																
Trap the Soul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemilichRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fort saving throw (DC 10 + demilich's HD + demilich's Cha modifier, DC %1). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich's form. The gem gleams wickedly for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw. Negative energy protection is effective against the level loss.|TrapTheSoulDC	KEY:Demilich ~ Trap the Soul				DEFINE:TrapTheSoulDC|0					BONUS:VAR|TrapTheSoulDC|10+HD+CHA	BONUS:VAR|TrapTheSoulDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Trap the Soul)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Trap the Soul									SOURCEPAGE:ELH

# Worm that Walks Template																																
Engulf	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WormThatWalksRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A worm that walks can choose to engulf an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than itself. The worm attempts to embrace its victim, and with a successful melee touch attack, the victim is immediately swallowed up and surrounded by a mass of vermin, taking 100 points of damage as the biting vermin nibble away at their latest meal. A victim who spends a full-round action can break free of the embrace and move up to half its speed away from the worm if desired, but can do nothing else. Otherwise, each round a victim remains embraced, it takes another 100 points of damage. Constructs are immune to this attack.	KEY:Worm that Walks ~ Engulf																											SOURCEPAGE:ELH

Frightful Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WormThatWalksRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a worm that walks engulfs a victim, witnesses must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the worm's HD + the worm's Cha modifier, DC %1). Those who make the save are shaken. Those who fail by 5 or fewer points are frightened. Those who fail by 6 to 10 points are panicked. Those who fail by 11 or more points are cowering. See the Condition Summary section in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide for descriptions of all these conditions, which last for 1d4 rounds. Those who have seen a worm use this attack before gain a +5 bonus on their saving throws. The victim of the worm's engulf attack has a -5 penalty on his or her saving throw.|FrightfulPresenceDC	KEY:Worm that Walks ~ Frightful Presence				DEFINE:FrightfulPresenceDC|0					BONUS:VAR|FrightfulPresenceDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|FrightfulPresenceDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Frightful Presence)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Frightful Presence									SOURCEPAGE:ELH
Discorporate	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WormThatWalksRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If gravely threatened, a worm can discorporate as a free action, simply falling into a pile of individual vermin that slither quickly away, making their escape by burrowing into the earth, slipping through holes in the wainscoting, or the like. So long as any of the component vermin survive, they can breed and create a new body to house the wizard's intelligence and personality. Discorporating is a dangerous tactic, because once separated, the vermin are treated no differently than other vermin. Also, the worm stands a good chance of losing all its equipment. However, discorporation almost assures that at least one maggot (if not dozens) will manage to crawl away, and so provide for the worm's continued existence.
