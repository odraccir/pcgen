Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BeholderMageClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Whenever a beholder mage gains the ability to cast a new level of spells, it must sacrifice the spell-like power of one of its ten small eyestalks. From then on, that eyestalk casts spells of that level, and is referred to as a spell-stalk. For example, a 3rd-level beholder mage that can cast 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells will have had to convert four of its eyestalks into spell-stalks. Every round in which a beholder mage casts spells and/or uses its eyestalks, it may cast one spell with each of its spell-stalks. Consequently, a beholder mage can cast more than one spell each round, but each spell cast must be of a different level, by a different stalk. The standard beholder limitation against turning more than three eyestalks in any particular direction except for up (that is, forward, backward, left, right, or down) still applies.

Spell Components	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BeholderMageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beholder mages do not require material components to cast their spells. The ruined central eye acts as an arcane focus for all of a beholder mage's spells. The somatic components of a beholder mage's spells are supplied by the weaving and waving of its spellstalks. The verbal component for all of a beholder mage's spells is the beholder mage's special spellcasting song. The song takes effort; a beholder mage that is casting a spell cannot speak or use its mouth to do anything else that round.
