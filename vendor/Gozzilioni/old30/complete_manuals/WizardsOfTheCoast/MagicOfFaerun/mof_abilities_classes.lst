Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GnomeArtificerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Gnome artificers are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.

Artificer Item	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GnomeArtificerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A gnome artificer has the ability to craft nonmagical devices that duplicate the effects of certain spells. Rather than using magic to accomplish this, he uses his knowledge of pistons, gears, lenses, and other simple mechanical inventions. As a result, an artificer item usually appears unwieldy and complex, with many attachments, lenses, protrusions, wires, and hoses. By default, all artificer devices use two item spaces: any one space plus either the "belt" or "cloak" space. It is possible to build devices that take up only one space, but they cost twice as much. An artificer can only craft artificer devices that duplicate the effects of the artificer device powers he knows (see below). All artificer devices have charges, representing fuel and other substances needed to provide the effect. After a certain number of uses, the device ceases to function until the artificer expends more time and money to rebuild it. For example, an artificer creates a bracerlike device that gives its wearer the equivalent of a bull's strength spell; the device has 50 charges, and when those charges are used, the device's power no longer functions until an artificer rebuilds it. Rebuilding a device costs half as much as it would cost to make it from scratch.	KEY:Gnome Artificer ~ Artificer Item																										SORTKEY:Class_Gnome_Artificer	SOURCEPAGE:MoF30	
Artificer Device Power	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GnomeArtificerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:While mages wield arcane power and clerics manipulate divine energy, the artificer uses mundane tools and strange reagents to produce impressive results. Like a neophyte wizard with a small repertoire of spells, an artificer starts with a few technological tricks that he has mastered. As he gains levels, the artificer learns new device powers automatically as shown on Table 3-1: The Gnome Artificer. The artificer can also purchase information on other device powers from other artificers or find them in books of crafting, with the prices and value of such objects equal to a scroll of the equivalent spell level.

The item functions aThis artificer level. The artificer is assumed to have been working on this item in his spare time, and does not need to spend any money or time to acquire the item. The gnome artificer gains another bonus item every even-numbered level thereafter.	KEY:Gnome Artificer ~ Bonus Item																										SORTKEY:Class_Gnome_Artificer	SOURCEPAGE:MoF30

Salvage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GnomeArtificerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An artificer of at least 5th level can dismantle a device (whether built by him or by another artificer) and use its pieces as parts for another device. This reduces the base price of the new device by 1/2 the market price of the device being dismantled. A device without full charges is worth only a percentage of its original market price equal to the percentage of charges remaining.

Prototype	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GnomeArtificerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 7th level, an artificer can make a device that has a device power that he doesn't know. These prototype items cost double the normal amount and are unreliable. Every time an artificer uses a prototype ability, he must make an artificer level check (DC = device power's artificer level +1) to activate the device successfully. Any other creature trying to activate the prototype device power has a -5 penalty on this check. Failure indicates a mishap (see the Artificer Prototype Mishaps sidebar on the previous page). If a mishap occurs, the charge for that attempted use is expended, regardless of the mishap's outcome. The device power used in a prototype must be on the device power list, and the artificer can't build a prototype that incorporates powers requiring the shadow effect ability until he reaches 9th level.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats, for example). If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a guild wizard, she must decide to which class she adds each level of guild wizard for purposes of determining spells per day when she adds the new level.

Membership in the order incurs the following duties and responsibilities: &nl;- Monthly membership dues of 25 gp (payable up to 1 year in advance);&nl; Obedience to the rulings of the masters;&nl; Aid to other members in time of need (this normally means aiding other order members who are in danger, but can mean aiding them in their other endeavors as well);&nl; Defense of the city of Waterdeep when called upon by the Masters or legitimate authorities of the Waterdhavian government;&nl;- Devotion of personal time and energy to the order (10%% XP penalty).

City officials call upon the order to assist in preventing widespread destruction when rogue spellcasters threaten the city. As a result, the order has perfected its ability to use counterspell techniques to eliminate the threat of such reckless magic use.

Spelldance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpelldancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Spelldancing is a means of increasing the effectiveness of a spell by performing a vigorous magical dance before casting. The spelldancer chooses one or more metamagic feats she knows to apply to a spell she wants to cast and begins her spelldancing. (Spells from the schools of Invocation and Necromancy can't be enhanced via spelldancing.) When she finishes spelldancing, she makes a Perform check with a DC of 10 + spell level (as modified by the metamagic feats). If she fails, the spell fizzles with no effect. If she succeeds, she casts the spell and it is modified by the selected metamagic feats (without the level of the spell being altered). For every spell level higher than normal that a metamagic feat alters a spell, one full round of spelldancing is required to alter the spell. The spelldancer dances the required number of rounds, and on her next action she may cast a spell with the chosen metamagic feat (if she doesn't cast a spell that round, the spelldancing effect is lost). For example, a spelldancer could choose to empower a bull's strength spell, spelldance for 2 full rounds (the spell level adjustment for Empower Spell), then cast bull's strength (as a standard action) with the benefits of Empower Spell. Still Spell and Quicken Spell can never be used in conjunction with spelldancing. A spelldancer needs to know the metamagic feat in question to spelldance the effects of that feat. Spelldancing requires extended motion. A spelldancing character has to move at least half her speed as part of her action on any round she spelldances. This movement is included in the full-round action of spelldancing, and means the spelldancer cannot take a 5-foot step on any round she spelldances. While spelldancing, the caster provokes attacks of opportunity normally, although she can still make Tumble checks to avoid attacks of opportunity. A spelldancer can safely spelldance a number of rounds per day equal to her Constitution modifier plus her spelldancer class level. Every spell she casts with spelldancing after that causes her to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + total rounds spent spelldancing in the last day) to avoid taking 2 points of temporary Constitution damage and becoming fatigued (if already fatigued, the character becomes exhausted and can't spelldance again until only fatigued).

Enthralling Dance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpelldancerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per day, a 2nd-level spelldancer can enthrall targets with a special dance. The effect is identical to the enthrall spell, except that it requires no vocal component and requires dancing as its somatic component. The DC to resist is equal to 10 + spelldancer level + Charisma modifier. The effect lasts as long as the spelldancer continues dancing (which is otherwise identical to spelldancing). At 4th level, the spelldancer can use her enthralling dance twice per day.

Evasion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpelldancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Evasion	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, a spelldancer gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage (such as fireball), she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Evasion can only be used if the spelldancer is wearing light armor or no armor.	KEY:Spelldancer ~ Evasion																										SORTKEY:Class_Spelldancer	SOURCEPAGE:MoF30	
Cooperative Dance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SpelldancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 3rd-level spelldancer can coordinate with another dancing character to share some of the effort of casting spells with spelldancing. The assisting character must dance during the same rounds as the spelldancer and then make a Perform check; for every 10 points of the check, the "cost" of the spelldance is reduced by 1 round (to a maximum reduction of 3 rounds for a check result of 30 or greater). This doesn't decrease the number of rounds required for the spelldance; it simply means that not as many rounds are deducted from the spelldancer's total number of spelldancing rounds per day. The cooperative dance can't reduce the number of rounds of spelldancing "spent" by the spelldancer to less than one for any casting, and the spelldancer can only coordinate with one character per spelldance.
