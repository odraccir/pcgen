Call of the Ocean	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AugiskyRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Whenever the Aughisky can hear or see the ocean, it will attempt to return to the water. Thus, capturing and maintaining one of these beasts is extremely difficult. The get it away from the water it must be captured or ridden away. To perform the latter, the character who would do so must mount the Aughisky and then succeed at three consecutive Ride Skill checks at DC 17. Each time the character fails, the Aughisky moves at its maximum speed towards the waters. Likewise, a previously broken Aughisky will attempt to return to the ocean if it can hear or see the waves. The rider must succeed at three consecutive Ride Skill checks at DC I7 or the beast will move inevitably towards the sea. Each failed check moves the Aughisky its maximum speed closer. Once the creature has made contact with the water, it cannot be stopped. It will move unabated out to the depths of the ocean. To dismount, the character must succeed at a Reflex Save at DC 22. He or she can continue to attempt to save each round, but each failure moves the character the Aughisky's maximum Speed out into the ocean. After the second round, the monster submerges completely and keeps swimming further out. Rules for Holding Breath and Drowning immediately come into play.
