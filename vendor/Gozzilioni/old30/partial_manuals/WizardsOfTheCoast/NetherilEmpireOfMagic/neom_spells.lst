Karsus’s Avatar				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Invocation|Evocation|Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Charm		CLASSES:Wizard=12	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:6 hours	RANGE:Unlimited	TARGETAREA:a God.	DURATION:Unlimited	SAVEINFO:Special	SPELLRES:No	DESC:Karsus spent well over a decade researching this spell. It was so complex that he had to use a stone-filled gizzard of a gold dragon and part of the epidermis of the pituitary gland of the tarrasque just to enchant one of the material components of the spell. This spell allowed the caster to become a god of his choosing, replacing a current god with himself the moment the spell was completed. Whether the gods received a saving throw, were aware of its casting, and other factors were unknown. The notes regarding the spell’s essence were nowhere to be found. It’s believed Mystra, the reincarnated form of Mystryl, snatched the spell information from the ruins of Karsus’s enclave and sent it on an eternal journey to the ends of the universe. Material Component: Unknown.	SOURCEPAGE:NEoM30								
Lefeber’s Weave Mythal				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Invocation|Evocation			CLASSES:Wizard=10	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:3 days	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:300 ft. Radius sphere/level	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell created a spherical force of magic that required an activation of some sort to allow entry. All living creatures‚ undead creatures‚ animated objects‚ and the like unfamiliar with the activation key were unable to penetrate the perimeter of the spell. Lefeber included a number of activation formulae for his new Mythal‚ and the archwizards who adopted this protection used some of his ideas or created their own The method used to penetrate a mythal included: somatic movement‚ word‚ or phrase activator; proper alignment or motivation; riding a specific kind of mount; humming a few bars of a song; or an item with a magical imprint of some sort. When creating a mythal, the size of the spherical protection was based on the level of the spellcaster—this was the maximum size of the sphere. The size, however, could be smaller if the arcanist desired. Once cast, the arcanist lost one level of experience, but was able to attach one additional spell or effect for every five levels of the caster (rounded down) to the mythal sphere. For instance, a lightning bolt could be attached to the mythal to attack anyone who neglected to use the activation key to gain entry, and this lightning bolt would strike as many targets as the arcanist had levels when the mythal was created.

Mavin’s Create Volcano				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning		CLASSES:Wizard=10	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:1 day	RANGE:1 mile/level	TARGETAREA:Special	DURATION:1 year	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell was never cast in Netheril‚ but every arcanist that looked at its formula was convinced that it would do as promised: create a volcano. Numerous ideas were brought forward to rid Netheril of the threat of orcs, goblins, and other undesirable creatures, but the threat to other ground-dwelling creatures (including the dwarves, elves, and other groundling cities) was too great. According to spell notes, the casting of the spell would produce a minor earthquake in the effect’s area. Within a week, ash and steam would be seen pouring through the earth. Within a month, a complete, erupting volcano would be present. Material Component: The material components for this spell included a mantle of sewn diamonds that acted as double-strength ring of fire restitance, a helm of brilliance, and a mythallar, which was placed at the site of the volcano.

Mavin’s Earthfast				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Abjuration			CLASSES:Wizard=10	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:1 mile/level	TARGETAREA:1 mile/level.	DURATION:1 year/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell was initially created to allow further mining of areas that were too dangerous to work otherwise. By casting the earthfast spell, large areas of underground tunnels became impervious to cave-ins and other similar catastrophes, the magic supporting the ceiling so that additional mining could continue. The spell was also used for other purposes, since it also drastically halted the weathering of city streets and buildings. Many cities sought out archwizards who would cast the earthfast spell to preserve important areas of their community. Material Component: The material components for this spell were a stone of controlling earth elementals, six chardalyns (each of which was imbued with a transmute mud to rock spell), and an earth elemental. All of the components were consumed during casting.	SOURCEPAGE:NEoM30								
Mavin’s Worldweave				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Conjuration|Necromancy	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning		CLASSES:Wizard=11	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:1 mile/level.	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:The worldweave allowed an archwizard to change the weather patterns of a large parcel of land until dispelled. Throughout Netheril’s existence, this spell was used hundreds of times to stay the effects of the polar ice in its northern borders. This gave Netheril’s land a temperate climate instead of one more suited for its placement on the globe—a subarctic clime. With cast, the archwizard was able to change the climate of an area by one grade—either up or down. Refer to the table below to determine the grade changes possible. It was possible to change the climate more than one step, but multiple layers of Mavin’s worldweave were required.	SOURCEPAGE:NEoM30								
Proctiv’s Breach Crystal Sphere				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Abjuration			CLASSES:Wizard=11	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:1 round.	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:one Sphere of existance	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell allowed the caster to permanently close a crystal sphere to all traffic (if the reverse of the spell was used), though teleport spells would function. Casting the spell in its normal form superseded any previous seal cast on it, and traffic through the sphere was once again possible. (Any sphere sealed by this spell before the fall of Netheril was closed and cannot be entered except through the use of teleport spells). The sealing of a sphere prevented spelljamming vessels from entering its space. Only through planar travel, teleportation magic, or other mystical means could one gain entry to a crystal sphere sealed by this spell. Material Component:The material component for this spell was a 100-ton spelljamming vessel that contained a major helm, which was consumed at the utterance of the spell	SOURCEPAGE:NEoM30								
Proctiv’s Move Mountain				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Abjuration			CLASSES:Wizard=11	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:2 hours	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:a Mountain	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell was vital in the construction of enclaves. Without this spell, there was no simple way for severed mountains to be turned over and set afloat above the landscape. When this spell was cast, the archwizard simply viewed the mountain he wanted to affect and the mountain was severed from the earth, leaving a flat mesa behind. The mountain was then turned over so the flat side was up, and the move mountain spell allowed this new structure to levitate. Once this was accomplished, the archwizard could begin constructing a city upon its smooth surface. Material Components: The material components for this spell were a mythallar (which needed magical device to be placed in the new city within two weeks), a that allowed flying or levitation, and a crystal ball.

Tolodine’s Killing Wind				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning		CLASSES:Wizard=10	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 round.	RANGE:100 yard/level	TARGETAREA:100 yard/level	DURATION:1 hour/level	SAVEINFO:Special	SPELLRES:No	DESC:Tolodine’s killing wind was designed to kill large numbers of creatures, and it worked well. When cast, billowing vapors moved away from the caster at an incredible rate of speed, overtaking anything within the area of effect unless magical means were used to escape Creatures caught within the cloud were entitled to a single saving throw versus spells to resist being killed by the spell. Creatures made a saving throw with a modifier based on the caster’s sacrifice. The casting of this spell automatically drained two life-levels from the caster (though for purposes of area of effect, range, and duration, the caster’s original level was used). In addition, the caster could opt to sacrifice more life energy, imposing a -1 penalty to all saving throws for every two levels so sacrificed (up to a maximum of -10). The one side effect to this, however, was that there was a 5% chance per level drained voluntarily that the caster’s essence would be pulled into the Negative Energy plane Forever. If pulled into the Negative Material Plane, one of two things occurred. If the caster was alive, the essence was consumed and the caster killed. The spellcaster was lost forever and couldn’t be resurrected or brought back to life in any way. If the spellcaster was undead, the essence continued to exist but it was trapped in the Negative Material Plane.	SOURCEPAGE:NEoM30								
Valdick’s Spheresail				TYPE:Spell	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning		CLASSES:Wizard=10	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One watercraft.	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:The archwizard Valdick loved to travel—not through the planes, but through the Prime Material plane. Travel between crystal spheres was his favorite, but he didn’t like the amount of time required to traverse these long distances, therefore he created the spheresail spell. Unlike spelljamming helms, which converted magical energy into motive force, the spheresail gained its power from one of two sources, depending upon where it was being used. Within a crystal sphere, the spell dipped directly into the magical forces of the goddess Mystryl and converted this raw power into motion‚ giving the spelljamming craft great spell (a maximum Movement Rate of 20 near planets or double-spelljamming speed in the intervening space between celestial bodies). This allowed the user to go from one planet to another quickly or from one city to another at lightning speed. Outside a crystal sphere, the spheresail spell focused on the gravitational energies of the destination sphere, pulling itself along these lines, gaining speed. By using this spell, a spelljamming vessel could traverse the distance in half the time ordinary spelljamming crafts were able to move. Cast upon a vessel designed specifically for spelljamming or on any watercraft, the spell was permanent until dispelled by an arcanist of equal or greater level. The effects of the spheresail could be turned off and activated at will as many times daily as needed.	SOURCEPAGE:NEoM30
