# Demilich Template																																
Trap the Soul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DemilichRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fort saving throw (DC 10 + demilich's HD + demilich's Cha modifier, DC %1). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich's form. The gem gleams wickedly for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw. Negative energy protection is effective against the level loss.|TrapTheSoulDC	KEY:Demilich ~ Trap the Soul				DEFINE:TrapTheSoulDC|0					BONUS:VAR|TrapTheSoulDC|10+HD+CHA	BONUS:VAR|TrapTheSoulDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Trap the Soul)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Trap the Soul									SOURCEPAGE:ELH
