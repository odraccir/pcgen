Special: You may gain this feat multiple times.

However, in order to manifest the power, your key ability score must be equal to or higher than the total power point cost minus 2. You must use this feat as a member of the class in which you can already manifest powers of the normal maximum level. For instance, a 5th-level psychic warrior/22ndlevel psion couldn't advance her power point cost limit in psychic warrior, because she can't manifest powers of the normal maximum level for a psychic warrior.

For example, if your base attack bonus plus epic attack bonus were +24, you could make four separate melee attacks as a single standard action. You can't attack any one opponent more than once as part of this action. These attacks (as well as all other attacks made until the start of your next turn) suffer a -4 penalty. When you use the Improved Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as Cleave or the haste spell).

To be affected, an ally must hear the bard sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the bard sings and for 5 rounds after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bard). While singing, the bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence bonus to the same ability score, which you must choose before you begin inspiring. For instance, you could grant all allies a bonus to Strength, or all allies a bonus to Constitution, but you couldn't grant some allies a bonus to Strength and some a bonus to Constitution with the same performance.

DESC:All variable, numeric effects of an intensified spell are maximized, then doubled. An intensified spell deals twice maximum damage, cures twice the maximum number of hit points, affects twice the maximum number of targets, and so forth, as appropriate. For example, an intensified horrid wilting spell would deal 16 points of damage per caster level (up to a maximum of 400 points of damage at 25th level). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you cast dispel magic) are not affected. An intensified spell uses up a spell slot seven levels higher than the spell's actual level.

Positive Energy Aura	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	VISIBLE:YES			PRELEVEL:MIN=21	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Turn Undead									PRESTAT:1,CHA=25					PRESPELL:1,Dispel Evil				DESC:Every undead creature that comes within 15 feet of you is automatically affected as if you had turned it. This doesn't cost a turning attempt, and you don't have to roll turning damage (it automatically affects all undead in a 15-foot burst), but it only turns undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than your effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically destroys undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than your effective cleric level minus 20). For example, a 22nd-level cleric would automatically turn any nearby wights or wraiths and would automatically destroy any Medium-size skeletons or zombies that came near him, but would have to turn nightshades and the like normally. Just as with normal turning, you can't affect undead that have total cover relative to you.																	SOURCEPAGE:ELH												
Ranged Inspiration	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	VISIBLE:YES			PRELEVEL:MIN=21	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bardic Music						PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=25												DESC:Double the range of any bardic music ability that has a range. For instance, you can use countersong to protect creatures within 60 feet of you (rather than 30 feet); you can fascinate a creature up to 180 feet away; and you can inspire competence or greatness in an ally up to 60 feet away. (If the creature must hear the bard to be affected by the ability, that requirement doesn't change regardless of any extended range the bard's ability may have.) Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack. Remember that two doublings equals a tripling, and so forth.

Thus, you could use the countersong as a reaction to a sonic or language-dependent magical attack. You can't use Reactive Countersong at the same time  you are using another bardic music ability (though you could stop the other bardic music ability to begin Reactive Countersong if so desired).

This ability doesn't stack with similar abilities (for instance, if some other effect has granted the axiomatic property to your unarmed strike).																	SOURCEPAGE:ELH												
Ruinous Rage	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	VISIBLE:YES			PRELEVEL:MIN=21	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack,Sunder									PRESTAT:1,STR=25						PREVARGTEQ:RageTimes,5			DESC:While in a rage, you ignore the hardness of any object you strike. Also, double your Strength bonus for the purposes of any Strength check made to break an object with sudden force rather than by dealing normal damage (including bursting bindings, such as ropes or manacles).

For instance, you could scribe a scroll with spells of greater than 9th level, or a scroll with a caster level greater than 20th. Even this feat does not allow you to scribe a scroll with an epic spell (see Chapter 2: Epic Spells). Such magic defies the power of the written word and thus cannot be scribed into scroll form.																	SOURCEPAGE:ELH

The break DC remains the same. Using Shattering Strike is a full-round action that incurs attacks of opportunity. You can't use Shattering Strike to escape bonds (unless you are so bound as to allow you to make an unarmed strike against your bindings, such as when you are bound by a length of chain).

If another spellcaster within 300 feet of you uses this magic, you also immediately gain the magic's effect as if it had been used on you by the same caster. You must have direct line of effect to the spellcaster in order to gain the benefit of the attuned magic (though you do not have to know the spellcaster is present, and you can be flat-footed). The magic's duration, effect, and other specifics are determined by its original caster's level.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE														SOURCEPAGE:ELH

Whenever the chosen form of magic would otherwise end due to a dispel effect, the magic is instead only suppressed for 1d4 rounds. The magic still ends when its duration expires, but the suppressed rounds do not count against its duration.
