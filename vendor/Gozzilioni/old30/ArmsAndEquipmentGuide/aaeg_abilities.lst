Don't Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AnimalTrick.AnimalTrickDonTAttack		DESC:This is not a command but a standing order.

Stonecunning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Special	VISIBLE:NO		KEY:Stonecunning Armor ~ Dwarf	BONUS:VAR|StonecunningSearchBonus|4|TYPE=Circumstance	SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=11|Stone Shape|Stone Tell
Stonecunning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Special	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability grants a +%1 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Dwarves have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground homes.|StonecunningSearchBonus	KEY:Stonecunning Armor ~ Human				DEFINE:StonecunningSearchBonus|0					BONUS:VAR|StonecunningSearchBonus|2|TYPE=Racial	BONUS:SITUATION|Search=Notice unusual stonework|StonecunningSearchBonus|TYPE=Racial																	SOURCEPAGE:AaEG
