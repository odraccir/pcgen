Discipline	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Every psion must decide at 1st level which psionic discipline he will specialize in. Choosing a discipline provides a psion with access to the class skills associated with that discipline (see above), as well as the powers restricted to that discipline. However, choosing a discipline also means that the psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can't even use such powers by employing psionic items. (See Psionic Disciplines, below, for a brief description of each discipline. Chapter 5 of this book contains a list of powers available to all psions and lists of powers restricted to certain disciplines).

This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels (as given on Table 3-2: Experience and Level- ependent Benefi ts, page 22 of the Player's Handbook).

In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table 2-1: Ability Modifi ers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items. A 1st-level psychic warrior gains no power points for his class level, but he gains bonus power points (if he is entitled to any), and can manifest the single power he knows with those power points.

Bonus Feats	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsychicWarriorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, a psychic warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1stlevel character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The psychic warrior gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every three levels thereafter (5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fi ghter bonus feats on Table 5-1: Feats, page 90 of the Player's Handbook, or from the psionic feats in Chapter 3 of this book. The psychic warrior must still meet all prerequisites for the bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums as well as class requirements. A psychic warrior cannot choose feats that specifi cally require levels in the fi ghter class (such as Greater Weapon Focus or Weapon Specialization) unless he is a multiclass character with the requisite levels in the fi ghter class. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels (as given on Table 3-2: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefi ts, page 22 of the Player's Handbook). A psychic warrior is not limited to fi ghter bonus feats and psionic feats when choosing these other feats.

Mind Blade	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. He can also choose mind blade for feats requiring a specifi c weapon choice, such as Weapon Specialization. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade. A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls (+2 at 8th level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at 16th level, and +5 at 20th level).

Throw Mind Blade	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet. Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).	KEY:Soulknife ~ Throw Mind Blade																										SORTKEY:Class_Soulknife	SOURCEPAGE:EPH													
Psychic Strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mind-affecting effects.) A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action. Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it. At every four levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the extra damage from a soulknife's psychic strike increases as shown on Table 2-5.

Free Draw	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however (if, for example, he must make a Will save to materialize it within a null psionics field).	KEY:Soulknife ~ Free Draw																										SORTKEY:Class_Soulknife	SOURCEPAGE:EPH													
Shape Mind Blade	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to change the form of his mind blade. As a fullround action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (damage 1d8 for a Medium weapon wielded as a one-handed weapon) or a bastard sword (damage 1d10 for a Medium weapon, but he must wield it as a two-handed weapon unless he knows the Exotic Weapon proficiency (bastard sword) feat). If a soulknife shapes his mind blade into the form of a bastard sword and wields it two-handed, he adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus to his damage rolls, just like when using any other twohanded weapon. Alternatively, a soulknife can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with a weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.) However, both mind blades have an enhancement bonus 1 lower than the soulknife would otherwise create with a single mind blade. For example, a 12th-level soulknife normally creates a single +3 mind blade, but he could use this ability to instead materialize two +2 mind blades.	KEY:Soulknife ~ Shape Mind Blade																										SORTKEY:Class_Soulknife	SOURCEPAGE:EPH													
Mind Blade Enhancement	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add any one of the weapon special abilities on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value of +1. At every four levels beyond 6th (10th, 14th, and 18th), the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his weapon improves to +2, +3, and +4, respectively. A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level. For example, an 18th-level soulknife could add two +2 weapon special abilities, or one +1 weapon ability and one +3 weapon ability. The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.

Bladewind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 9th level, a soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent. As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade. (For example, if the mind blade were in the form of a +1 keen bastard sword, due to the soulknife's mind blade enhancement and shape mind blade abilities, each fragment attacks and deals damage as a +1 keen bastard sword.) When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the haste spell). The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack.	KEY:Soulknife ~ Bladewind																										SORTKEY:Class_Soulknife	SOURCEPAGE:EPH

Knife to the Soul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 13th level, when a soulknife executes a psychic strike, he can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (his choice) for extra dice of damage. For each die of extra damage he gives up, he deals 1 point of damage to the ability score he chooses. A soulknife can combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination, so a 19th-level soulknife could choose to strike for 3 points of Charisma damage and an extra 2d6 points of damage.  The soulknife decides which ability score his psychic strike damages and the division of ability damage and extra dice of damage when he imbues his mind blade with the psychic strike energy.	KEY:Soulknife ~ Knife to the Soul																										SORTKEY:Class_Soulknife	SOURCEPAGE:EPH													
Multiple Throw	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.SoulknifeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 17th level and higher, a soulknife can throw a number of mind blades per round equal to the number of melee attacks he could make. Thus, a 17th-level soulknife could throw two mind blades, with a base attack bonus of +12/+7. If he had used shape mind blade to materialize a mind blade for each hand and thus fight with two weapons, he could throw four mind blades in a round.

Power Points per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WilderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A wilder's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points she has available. Her base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 2-6: The Wilder. In addition, she receives bonus power points per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 2-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points).

Wild Surge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WilderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains phenomenal psionic strength,  but may harm herself by the reckless use of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below). A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the ability to augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is effectively supplied by the wild surge. Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge. This improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other benefits (psicrystal abilities do not advance, she does not gain higher-level class abilities, and so on). She cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat (see page 49) and invoke her wild surge at the same time.

Psychic Enervation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WilderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Pushing oneself by invoking a wild surge is dangerous. Immediately following each wild surge, a wilder may be overcome by the strain of her effort. Thechance of suffering psychic enervation is equal to 5%% per manifester level added with the wild surge. For example, if, at 11th level, Leila uses wild surge to boost her manifester level by four, she has a 20%% chance of suffering psychic enervation as a result. A wilder who is overcome by psychic enervation is dazed until the end of her next turn and loses a number of power points equal to her wilder level.

Elude Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WilderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a wilder's intuition supersedes her intellect, alerting her to danger from touch attacks (including rays). She gains a bonus to Armor Class against all touch attacks equal to her Charisma bonus; however, her touch AC can never exceed her Armor Class against normal attacks.

Surging Euphoria	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WilderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 4th level, when a wilder uses her wild surge ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the intensity of her wild surge. For example, if Leila uses wild surge to boost her manifester level by two, her morale bonus would last for 2 rounds. (Even if she had the wild surge +4 ability, the fact that she boosted her manifester level by only two restricts the duration to 2 rounds.) If a wilder is overcome by psychic enervation following her wild surge, she does not gain the morale bonus for this use of her wild surge ability. At 12th level, the morale bonus on a wilder's attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws increases to +2. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +3.

Volatile Mind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WilderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A wilder's temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the discipline of telepathy. When any telepathy power is manifested on a wilder of 5th level or higher, the manifester of the power must pay 1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent. The extra cost is not a natural part of that power's cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted power point. The wilder's volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal power point limit of 1 point per manifester level. If the extra cost raises the telepathy power's cost to more points than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the rest of his power points. At 9th level, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a wilder is increased to 2 power points. At 13th level, the penalty increases to 3 power points, and at 17th level it increases to 4 power points. As a standard action, a wilder can choose to lower this effect for 1 round (in the event, for instance, that a friend attempts to manifest a benefi cial telepathy power on her).

From now on, she can fl oat a foot above the ground. Instead of walking she glides along, unconcerned with the hard earth or diffi cult terrain. While she remains within 1 foot of a fl at surface of any solid or liquid, she can take normal actions and make normal attacks, and can move at her normal speed (she can even "run" at four times her normal speed). However, at distances higher than 1 foot above any surface, her speed diminishes to 10 feet per round. While she remains within 1 foot of a surface, she can make melee and ranged attacks normally, but if she moves any higher, she incurs the penalties on melee and ranged attack rolls as if she were the subject of the psionic levitate power (see the levitate spell description, page 248 of the Player's Handbook).

She can designate the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time during her turn.

These powers are in addition to any powers the elocater normally learns by advancing a level. The elocater treats these powers as if they were 3rd-level powers on her class list. This means, among other things, that manifesting these powers costs 5 power points.

This ability can be used only against opponents within 60 feet to which the elocater has line of sight. She can dimension step up to the target, use Spring Attack, and then use dimension step to return to her starting point. (When she uses this ability, the total distance she can travel before and after the attack is not limited by her speed.)

Accelerated Action	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ElocaterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When she attains 10th level, an elocater can accelerate herself and thereby take more actions than normal. An elocater can accelerate herself for a total of 5 rounds per day. She can choose to parcel out her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects that provide additional actions, such as schism or a haste spell-and in fact an elocater can't take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects). If she makes a full attack while accelerated, an elocater can make one extra attack with any weapon she is holding. The attack is made using her full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. If the elocater uses her accelerated action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her speed of +30 feet. The elocater can use her accelerated action to manifest a power, as long as she has not already manifested a power in the current round and the one she wants to manifest has a manifesting time of 1 standard action or shorter. While accelerated, she gains a +2 dodge bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

Assume Equipment	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionUncarnateClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a psion uncarnate can designate a number of pieces of his worn equipment (including armor and weapons) equal to his psion uncarnate level to become incorporeal when he uses his shed body ability. This has no effect on the equipment's function, but now when the psion uncarnate is incorporeal, he can enter or pass through solid objects while wearing nothing other than the designated equipment. Once designated, the equipment automatically changes to incorporeal when the character sheds his body, and it returns to corporeality when the character does. The character can change his designations as he desires.	KEY:Psion Uncarnate ~ Assume Equipment																										SORTKEY:Class_Psion_Uncarnate	SOURCEPAGE:EPH													
Assume Likeness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionUncarnateClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:4th level and higher, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can assume the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character's abilities do not change, but he appears to be the creature that he assumes the likeness of, allowing him the ability to effectively disguise himself and bluff those who might wonder at his true nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a successful Bluff check (opposed by the creature's Sense Motive check) to convince the creature of the psion uncarnate's new appearance. The psion uncarnate must not do anything to give away his true (incorporeal) nature in order for the bluff to be successful; for instance, if he accepts an item from another creature only to have it fall through his immaterial hands, the Bluff check automatically fails. However, a Bluff check would be allowed if the psion uncarnate uses his telekinetic force ability (see below) to hold the received item. When using his assume likeness ability, a psion uncarnate has an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If he can read an opponent's mind, he gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.

Telekinetic Force	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionUncarnateClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 7th level, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can use a telekinetic force effect (see the power description, page 135) as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is equal to 14 + the psion uncarnate's key ability modifi er (either Int, Wis, or Cha). The character's manifester level is the manifester level of the effect. Even while corporeal, a psion uncarnate can use this ability, but only three times per day (uses while he is uncarnate do not count against this use limit).

Uncarnate Bridge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionUncarnateClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 8th level, as a creature of almost pure mind, a psion uncarnate becomes more closely attuned to the minds of other creatures. He gains the ability to transport himself via the minds of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action while incorporeal, he can seamlessly enter any living creature with an Intelligence score and pass to another living creature with an Intelligence score that is within line of sight of the first creature. The psion uncarnate must be in a space adjacent to the entry creature before transporting, and he appears in a space adjacent to the destination creature after transporting. The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar to the character. A psion uncarnate cannot use himself as the entry or destination creature. Neither creature need be a willing participant. When exiting the destination creature, the psion uncarnate chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and leaving a creature is painless, unless the psion uncarnate wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature fi nds being the endpoint of a mental bridge surprising and quite unsettling. If he desires, a psion uncarnate can destructively exit the destination creature. If the creature fails a Will save (DC 15 + psion uncarnate's key ability modifier), the exiting psion uncarnate tunes his mental form to destructively interfere with the target's mind. He bursts forth explosively from the creature's body, dealing it 10d6 points of damage.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of thrallherd to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly. If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a thrallherd, she must decide to which class she adds the new level of thrallherd for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

Thrallherd	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThrallherdClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A thrallherd who has just entered the class sends out a subtle psychic call for servants, and that call is answered. Essentially, the character gains something akin to the Leadership feat (see page 106 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), but with some important differences. Those who answer a thrallherd's call are not referred to as cohorts and followers, but rather as thralls and believers, respectively. They do not appear because they admire the character and want to serve her, but because a hidden psychic resonance connects the thrallherd and her servants. As with the Leadership feat, a thrallherd has a Leadership score that determines the highest-level thrall and believers she can attract. A thrallherd's Leadership score is equal to her character level + her Cha modifi er + her thrallherd level. (Note that her thrallherd level is counted twice.) This score is not affected by any of the modifi ers mentioned on page 106 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. As with the Leadership feat, the called thrall's level is limited, even if the character's Leadership score would indicate a higher-level thrall. Unlike with the Leadership feat, the level limit of a thrall is equal to the character's total level minus 1 (not level minus 2, as is true for cohorts). A thrallherd cannot take the Leadership feat; if the character already has it, the feat is lost and replaced by this ability; those who were previously cohorts and followers go their separate ways, and those who are more mentally pliable show up later to take up roles as thralls and believers. A thrallherd's fi rst thrall and believers arrive within 24 hours of her entry into this class; likewise, lost thralls and believers are replaced within 24 hours. Use the following table instead of the one in the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the level of a thrallherd's thrall and the number of believers of various levels a thrallherd can attract.
