DESC:When you expend your psionic focus, you can simultaneously use two feats that require a psionic focus to be expended, instead of just one.

Aligned Attack	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic	VISIBLE:YES		PREATT:6															PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match one of your alignment components; for example, if you are lawful good, you can choose either lawful or good, but not chaotic or evil). Once you've made this alignment choice, it cannot be changed. To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). When you make a successful melee or ranged attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your attack is treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

The benefits of this feat apply only to power resistance. The bonus does not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule (see page 55).

Body Fuel	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:You can recover 2 power points by taking 1 point of ability burn damage (see page 67) to each of your three ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. You can recover additional power points for a proportional cost; for example, you could choose to recover 6 power points by taking 3 points of ability burn damage to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These recovered points are added to your power point reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Boost Construct	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:When you create an astral construct, you can give it one additional special ability from any menu (see page 186) that the construct currently has an ability from.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Burrowing Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to bypass the barrier. The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a wall of ectoplasm). Force walls or walls of ectoplasm are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted otherwise. If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with clairvoyant sense. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Chain Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can chain any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fi re, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round down). Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example). Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Chaotic Mind	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,CHA=15			PREALIGN:CG,CN,CE	!PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight bonus to their Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill checks or ability checks do not gain those bonuses against you.

You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn't activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: &nl;(1) The power activates when you take a standard action to activate it; &nl;(2) It activates when a creature enters  the area that the power will affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or &nl;(3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. &nl;If you choose one of the first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth round. Only area and personal powers can be delayed. Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power, including saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends. A delayed power can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH

Augmented powers can also be empowered (multiply 1-1/2 times the damage total of the augmented power). Saving throws and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you manifest dispel psionics) are not affected, nor are powers without random variables. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH

Psionic Hole	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																	!PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:When a foe strikes you in melee combat, the foe immediately loses its psionic focus, if any. Also, if you are the target of a power, the manifester of the power must spend an additional number of power points equal to your Wisdom bonus, or the power fails (all the power points spent on the power are still lost). This extra cost does not count toward the maximum power points a manifester can spend on a single power.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH

Quicken Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can quicken a power. You can perform another action, even manifest another power, in the same round that you manifest a quickened power. You can manifest only one quickened power per round. A power whose manifesting time is longer than 1 round cannot be quickened. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level. Manifesting a quickened power does not provoke attacks of opportunity.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Rapid Metabolism	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:You naturally heal a number of hit points per day equal to the standard healing rate + double your Constitution bonus.

Once per round when you would normally be hit by a projectile or a thrown weapon no more than one size category larger than your size, you can defl ect the attack so that you take no damage from it. The attack is defl ected back at your attacker, using the attack bonus of the original attack on you. You must be aware of the attack and not fl at-footed. Attempting to return a shot is a free action. Special: If you also have the Defl ect Arrows feat (see page 93 of the Player's Handbook), the deflected attack is made with the original attack bonus plus your Dexterity bonus.

If a charging opponent fails to make a successful attack against you, you gain an immediate attack of opportunity.

You can split psionic rays you manifest. The split ray affects any two targets that are both within the power's range and within 30 feet of each other. If the ray deals damage, each target takes as much damage as a single target would take. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Stand Still	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,STR=13									DESC:When a foe's movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity, you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the round. Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could make an attack of opportunity (normally just one).

Talented	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic	VISIBLE:YES				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Overchannel													PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37).

Twin Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect). Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Unavoidable Strike	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic	VISIBLE:YES		PREATT:5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psionic Fist									PRESTAT:1,STR=13				PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can resolve your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Unconditional Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). Your mental strength is enough to overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, confused, nauseated, shaken, or stunned. Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 8. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Up the Walls	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic	VISIBLE:YES													PRESTAT:1,WIS=13				PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal fl oor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from fl oor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Widen Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	VISIBLE:YES																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power's area increase by 100%%. For example, an energy burst power (which normally produces a 40-foot-radius spread) that is widened now fi lls an 80- ootradius spread. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH					
Wild Talent	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:Your latent power of psionics fl ares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by virtue of having this feat.														BONUS:VAR|BasePowerPoints|2			SOURCEPAGE:EPH	TEMPLATE:Psionic				
Wounding Attack	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic	VISIBLE:YES		PREATT:8															PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can make an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1 point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.																	SOURCEPAGE:EPH

Hidden Talent	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES			PRELEVELMAX:1																			DESC:Your latent power of psionics fl ares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points, and you can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats.
