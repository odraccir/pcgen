Empathic Link	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendishServantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:The blackguard has an empathic link with his servant out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The blackguard cannot see through the servant's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content (such as fear, hunger, happiness, curiosity) can be communicated. Note that the low Intelligence of a lowlevel blackguard's fiendish servant limits what the creature is able to communicate or understand, and even intelligent servants see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible. Because of the empathic link between the servant and the blackguard, the blackguard has the same connection to a place or an item that the servant does.	KEY:Fiendish Servant ~ Empathic Link																											SOURCEPAGE:DMG		
Improved Evasion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendishServantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Evasion		DESC:If the servant is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage on a successful saving throw and only half damage on a failed saving throw. Improved evasion is an extraordinary ability.	KEY:Fiendish Servant ~ Improved Evasion																											SOURCEPAGE:DMG		
Share Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendishServantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality		DESC:At the blackguard's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his servant. The servant must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the servant if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the servant again even if the servant returns to the blackguard before the duration expires. Additionally, the blackguard may cast a spell with a target of "You" on his servant (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A blackguard and his servant can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the servant's type (magical beast).	KEY:Fiendish Servant ~ Share Spells																											SOURCEPAGE:DMG		
Share Saving Throws	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendishServantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality		DESC:For each of its saving throws, the servant uses either its own base save bonus or the blackguard's, whichever is higher. The servant applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the blackguard might have (such as from magic items or feats).	KEY:Fiendish Servant ~ Share Saving Throws																											SOURCEPAGE:DMG		
Speak with Blackguard	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendishServantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:If the blackguard's character level is 13th or higher, the blackguard and servant can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.	KEY:Fiendish Servant ~ Speak with Blackguard																											SOURCEPAGE:DMG		
Blood Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendishServantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:If the blackguard's character level is 16th or higher, the servant gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, checks, and saves if it witnesses the blackguard being threatened or harmed. This bonus lasts as long as the threat is immediate and apparent.	KEY:Fiendish Servant ~ Blood Bond																											SOURCEPAGE:DMG		
Spell Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.FiendishServantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:If the blackguard's character level is 19th or higher, the servant gains spell resistance equal to the blackguard's level + 5. To affect the servant with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the servant's spell resistance.
