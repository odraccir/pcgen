Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AdeptClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Adepts are skilled with all simple weapons. Adepts are not proficient with any type of armor nor with shields.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AdeptClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An adept casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to the cleric, druid, paladin, and ranger), which are drawn from the adept spell list (see below). Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare her spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells. To prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the adept's Wisdom modifier. Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each day at which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells. Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 4-2: The Adept. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). When Table 4-2 indicates that the adept gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 0 2nd-level spells for a 4th-level adept), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. Each adept has a particular holy symbol (as a divine focus) depending on the adept's magical tradition.	KEY:Adept ~ Spells																										SORTKEY:Class_Adept	SOURCEPAGE:DMG

Enhance Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneArcherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for her. For every two levels the character advances past 1st level in the prestige class, the magic arrows she creates gain +1 greater potency (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).

Imbue Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneArcherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.	KEY:Arcane Archer ~ Imbue Arrow																										SORTKEY:Class_Arcane_Archer	SOURCEPAGE:DMG	
Seeker Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneArcherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. For example, if the target is within a windowless chamber with the door closed, the arrow cannot enter. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).	KEY:Arcane Archer ~ Seeker Arrow																										SORTKEY:Class_Arcane_Archer	SOURCEPAGE:DMG	
Phase Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneArcherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (A wall of force, a wall of fire, or the like stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).	KEY:Arcane Archer ~ Phase Arrow																										SORTKEY:Class_Arcane_Archer	SOURCEPAGE:DMG	
Hail Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneArcherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In lieu of her regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.	KEY:Arcane Archer ~ Hail Arrow																										SORTKEY:Class_Arcane_Archer	SOURCEPAGE:DMG	
Arrow of Death	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneArcherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 10th level, an arcane archer can create an arrow of death that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain immediately. It takes one day to make an arrow of death, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The arrow of death lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Ranged Legerdemain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Using his unique talents, an arcane trickster can perform one of the following class skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, or Sleight of Hand. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. An arcane trickster can use ranged legerdemain once per day initially, twice per day upon attaining 5th level, and three times per day at 9th level or higher. He can make only one ranged legerdemain skill check each day, and only if he has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.

Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.

Impromptu Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArcaneTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack). At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.

Spells per Day	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a new archmage level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he added the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.	KEY:Archmage ~ Spells per Day																										SORTKEY:Class_Archmage	SOURCEPAGE:DMG	
High Arcana	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An archmage learns secret lore unknown to lesser wizards and sorcerers. She gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those described below by permanently eliminating one existing spell slot (she cannot eliminate a spell slot of higher level than the highest-level spell she can cast). Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as specified in its description. For example, a 15thlevel wizard normally can cast two 7th-level spells per day (bonus spells for specialization or high Intelligence can increase this number). A 13th-level wizard/2nd-level archmage who chooses the arcane reach ability forfeits one 7th-level spell slot, and so can only cast one 7th-level spell per day, not counting bonus spells. An archmage may choose to eliminate a spell slot of a higher level than that required to gain a type of high arcana.

Arcane Fire	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.HighArcana.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The archmage gains the ability to change arcane spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level of archmage) that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level of the archmage plus 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell used to create the effect. For instance, a 5thlevel archmage who channels a 7th-level spell into arcane fire deals 12d6 points of damage to the target if it hits. This ability costs one 9th-level spell slot.

Arcane Reach	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.HighArcana.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The archmage can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 30 feet away. The archmage must make a ranged touch attack. Arcane reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.

Mastery of Counterspelling	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.HighArcana.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When the archmage counterspells a spell, it is turned back upon the caster as if it were fully affected by a spell turning spell. If the spell cannot be affected by spell turning (for example, if it is a spell that affects an area), then it is merely counterspelled. This ability costs one 7thlevel spell slot.

Mastery of Elements	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.HighArcana.SpecialQuality.Metamagic	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The archmage can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses. For example, an archmage could cast a fireball that deals sonic damage instead of fire damage. This ability can only alter a spell with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The spell's casting time is unaffected. The caster decides whether to alter the spell's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting. This ability costs one 8th-level spell slot.

Mastery of Shaping	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.HighArcana.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The archmage can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell's area or effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. For example, an archmage could cast a fireball and leave a hole where his ally stands, preventing any fire damage. Furthermore, any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs one 6thlevel spell slot.

Spell Power	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.HighArcana.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability increases the archmage's effective caster level by +1 (for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables such as damage dice or range, and caster level checks only). This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot.

Spell-Like Abilities	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ArchmageClassFeatures.HighArcana.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An archmage who selects this type of high arcana can use one of her arcane spell slots (other than a slot expended to learn this or any other type of high arcana) to permanently prepare one of her arcane spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The archmage does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so and a spell with a costly material component instead costs her 10 times that amount in XP. This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot. The spell-like ability normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level, although the archmage can choose to make a spell modified by a metamagic feat into a spell-like ability at the appropriate spell level. For example, an archmage can make lightning bolt into a spell-like ability by using a 3rd-level spell slot to do so, or into a maximized lightning bolt by using a 6th-level spell slot. The archmage may use an available higher-level spell slot in order to use the spell-like ability more often. Using a slot three levels higher than the chosen spell allows her to use the spelllike ability four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets her use it six times per day. For example, Hexark, a 15th-level wizard/2nd-level archmage, is a pyromaniac and never wants to be denied the ability to cast fireball, so she permanently uses a 9th-level spell slot to get fireball as a spell-like ability usable six times per day. She forfeits a 5th-level spell slot to master the ability. If spell-like ability is selected more than one time as a high arcana choice, this ability can apply to the same spell chosen the first time (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An assassin's weapon training focuses on weapons suitable for stealth and sneak attacks. Assassins are proficient with the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Assassins are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

Death Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier, DC %1) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering her helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.|DeathAttackDC	KEY:Assassin ~ Death Attack									BONUS:VAR|DeatAttackLVL|AssassinLVL									ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Death Attack	ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Death Attack							SORTKEY:Class_Assassin	SOURCEPAGE:DMG

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, an assassin must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus (if any). When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level assassin), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a bard does. Upon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, an assassin could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highestlevel sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1stlevel spell. At 8th and 10th levels, he could trade in a single 1stlevel or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level assassin spells) for a different spell of the same level. An assassin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.

Uncanny Dodge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, an assassin gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.) If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).

Improved Uncanny Dodge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AssassinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, an assassin can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the assassin. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the assassin can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BlackguardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blackguard with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard's Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level blackguard), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard's spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric.

The increase in Constitution increases the defender's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position, such as Move Silently or Jump. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table 6-9). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action. (A defender can't, for example, use the stance when struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution.)

This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the dwarven defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).

This essentially means that she adds the level of eldritch knight to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.

The hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP. The spell normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level (or higher, if the hierophant chooses to permanently attach a metamagic feat to the spell chosen). The hierophant can use an available higher-level spell slot to use the spell-like ability more than once per day. Allocating a slot three levels higher allows him to cast the spell four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him cast it six times per day. For example, Lonafin the hierophant  wants to be able to create undead whenever he has the opportunity, so he permanently uses a 9th-level spell slot to get animate dead as a spell-like ability usable six times per day. If selected more than one time as a special ability, this ability can apply to the same spell (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

Summon Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade (see the Monster Manual for the shadow's statistics). Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow cannot be turned, rebuked, or commanded by any third party. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. Every third level gained by the shadowdancer adds +2 HD (and the requisite base attack and base save bonus increases) to her shadow companion. For example, a 9thlevel shadowdancer can have a shadow companion with 6 HD. If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer loses 200 experience points per shadowdancer level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss by half, to 100 XP per prestige class level. The shadowdancer's XP total can never go below 0 as the result of a shadow's dismissal or destruction. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.

The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 20 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (40 feet at 6th, 80 feet at 8th, and 160 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment. (A 6th-level shadowdancer who jumps 32 feet cannot jump again until the next day.)

Defensive Roll	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Starting at 5th level, a shadowdancer can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it. Once per day, when a shadowdancer would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), she can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll. If she is in a situation that would deny her any Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't attempt a defensive roll.

Improved Uncanny Dodge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a shadowdancer can no longer be flanked, since she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadowdancer. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadowdancer can flank her (and thus sneak attack her). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as barbarian or rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

Slippery Mind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ShadowdancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability, gained at 7th level, represents a shadowdancer's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a shadowdancer is affected by an enchantment and fails her saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw.

A shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage (breath weapon, fireball, and so on). What's more, she takes only half damage even if she fails her saving throw, since her reflexes allow her to get out of harm's way with incredible speed.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of thaumaturgist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a thaumaturgist, he must decide to which class he adds each level of thaumaturgist for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Improved Ally	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThaumaturgistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A thaumaturgist is adept at convincing creatures from other planes to do his bidding. When a thaumaturgist casts a planar ally spell (including the lesser and greater versions), he makes a Diplomacy check to convince the creature to aid him for a reduced payment. If the thaumaturgist's Diplomacy check adjusts the creature's attitude to helpful (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Player's Handbook), the creature will work for 50%% of the standard fee, as long as the task is one that is not against its nature. For example, a 1st-level thaumaturgist negotiating with an initially friendly planar ally that gets a Diplomacy check result of 15 can convince a 6 HD creature to perform a 7- hour task for only 1,500 gp per hour (a 6 HD creature would ordinarily ask for 3,000 gp per hour). The thaumaturgist's improved ally class feature only works when the planar ally shares at least one aspect of alignment with the thaumaturgist. A thaumaturgist can have only one such ally at a time, but he may bargain for tasks from other planar allies normally.

Contingent Summoning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ThaumaturgistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4th-level thaumaturgist can prepare a summoning or calling spell ahead of time to be triggered by some other event. This functions as described for the contingency spell, including having the thaumaturgist cast the summoning or calling spell beforehand. The spell is cast instantly when the trigger event occurs. For example, a thaumaturgist could use the contingent conjuration ability to summon a barbed devil the next time he is attacked, or call a ghaele eladrin to act as messenger if the king falls ill. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. If complicated or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered. The conjuration spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether the thaumaturgist wants it to, although most conjurations can be dismissed normally. A thaumaturgist can have only one contingent conjuration active at a time.	KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Contingent Summoning																										SORTKEY:Class_Thaumaturgist	SOURCEPAGE:DMG

For example, a 5th-level thaumaturgist could use planar ally to call a bralani eladrin to act as his cohort. As long as the thaumaturgist undertakes quests and missions to fight evil and uphold good, the eladrin will loyally serve. To call a planar cohort, the thaumaturgist must cast the relevant spell, paying the XP costs normally. It takes an offering of 1,000 gp x the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally class feature can't be used to reduce or eliminate this cost. The planar cohort can't have more Hit Dice than the thaumaturgist has, and must have an ECL no higher than the thaumaturgist's character level -2. A bralani eladrin has an ECL of 11 (6 Hit Dice and +5 level adjustment), so it might serve as a planar cohort to an 8th-level cleric/ 5th-level thaumaturgist (character level 13th). A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other called creatures normally. A planar cohort replaces a thaumaturgist's existing cohort, if he has one by virtue of the Leadership feat (page 106).
