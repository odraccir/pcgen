A bone ooze cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it attempts to engulf, but each creature engulfed is considered grappled and trapped within the bone ooze's body.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cloud ray can swallow a snatched opponent that is Huge or smaller by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +61). The cloud ray, however, has no appreciable stomach. Instead it has a long throat, the whole length of which is equipped with teeth for grinding and tearing food. Its throat empties directly into its intestines, so the ray must chew its food thoroughly to ensure proper digestion. Once inside the rays throat, the opponent takes 3d10+22 points of bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage per round from its teeth and muscular contractions. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the throat and return to the rays mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the throat (AC 12) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

KEY:Cloud Ray ~ Protection from Arrows																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Telekinesis	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Lacking any sort of hands or paws, the cloud ray instead uses telekinesis to manipulate objects. This ability works like the telekinesis spell (caster level 5th), so the creature can lift or throw 125 pounds.	KEY:Cloud Ray ~ Telekinesis																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Skills	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Thanks to its coloration, a cloud ray has a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks. *When it tires of drifting through the sky, it settles to the ground for rest. Through a combination of telekinesis and moving its great wing-flaps, it covers itself with dust, dirt, rocks, logs, uprooted bushes, and whatever else is nearby. While it is thus camouflaged, its Hide modifier rises to +32. The ray may rest on the ground thus covered for a few hours or a few weeks.

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a corpse gatherer hits an opponent its own size or smaller with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +39). If it gets a hold, it can try to swallow the opponent in the next round. Alternatively, the corpse gatherer has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its hand to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the corpse gatherer is not considered grappled). In either case, its next successful grapple check deals automatic slam damage.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Ingest Corpses	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The corpse gatherer increases its hit points by adding bodies to its form. It gains 5 hit points for every corpse of a swallowed creature that it absorbs. The corpse gatherer can exceed its normal hit points in this manner, gaining any excess as temporary hit points.Opponents the creature has swallowed are not subject to ingestion until the round after they die.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Ingest Corpses																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A corpse gatherer can swallow a grabbed opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +39). The creature need not use its mouth to swallow; it can merely stuff the opponent into any convenient portion of its porous body. Once inside the gatherer, the opponent takes 1d12+12 points of bludgeoning damage per round from the roiling corpses, gravestones, and other objects inside the creatures body. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to extract itself from the hands of the corpses inside the gatherer and return to the surface of the gatherers body, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the corpse gatherer (AC 14) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, the other nearby corpses close the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan corpse gatherer can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32Mediumsize, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Desanctifying Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A corpse gatherer projects a continual field of negative energy in a 100-foot-radius emanation. The area within this field is under the effect of a double-strength desecrate spell (caster level 15th), as if the corpse gatherer were a permanent feature dedicated to its own deity. Each turning attempt within this area has a -6 profane penalty. Further, each undead creature in the area (including the corpse gatherer) is entitled to a +2 profane bonus on its attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws, as well as +2 hit points per HD. This aura lasts for 24 hours after the corpse gatherer has passed through.

Soul Binding	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Creatures slain and ingested by a corpse gatherer are affected as if by a soul bind spell, so they cannot be restored to life. Destroying the corpse gatherer negates this effect. Corpses that the creature devours without having slain them itself are not subject to soul binding.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Soul Binding																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Zombie Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Upon reaching 0 hit points, the corpse gatherer falls apart into its component corpses. The creatures animating force remains among the corpses that formerly composed its body, converting them into zombies. Upon its death, a corpse gatherer generates as many zombies as it has Hit Dice (that is, a 30-HD corpse-gatherer becomes thirty zombies). Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, these are allMedium-size zombies.They function normally as long as they remain in the desanctified area of the dead corpse gatherer, but outside its effect they revert to normal corpses.

Blood Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrimsonDeathRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A crimson death drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage immediately upon seizing an opponent with a tendril. Each round thereafter that the opponent remains seized, the creature automatically deals an additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Seize	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrimsonDeathRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a crimson death makes a successful incorporeal touch attack, one of its tendrils wraps around the opponent.

Upon seizing an opponent, the crimson death begins draining blood (see above).	KEY:Crimson Death ~ Seize																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Lift	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrimsonDeathRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a free action, a crimson death can telekinetically lift another creature or an object weighing up to 300 pounds. This ability works like the telekinesis spell (sustained force version, caster level 12th), except that it works only on an opponent already seized by a tendril of the crimson death. Against a struggling opponent, use of this ability requires a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +11).	KEY:Crimson Death ~ Lift																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Thereafter, the darktentacles has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tentacle to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the darktentacles is  not considered grappled).
