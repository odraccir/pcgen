Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbeilSubRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If an abeil hits a single target that is at least one size category smaller than itself with both claws, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (see below for grapple bonuses). If it gets a hold, it automatically hits with its sting. Thereafter, the abeil has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its claws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the abeil is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals damage from both claws and the sting.

The elemental must make a successful Will save (DC %1) or succumb to the weird's control. An elemental that saves against this attack is immune to that weird's elemental command ability for 24 hours. There is no limit to the number of elementals that a weird can control. Once under the weird's control, an elemental serves the weird until either it or the weird dies, until the weird dismisses it, or until the duration for its summoning expires. It obeys the weird explicitly, even if ordered to attack the being who originally summoned it. The weird does not need to concentrate to maintain control over any elemental it commands.|ElementalCommandDC	KEY:Elemental Weird ~ Elemental Command				DEFINE:ElementalCommandDC|0					BONUS:VAR|ElementalCommandDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|ElementalCommandDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Elemental Command)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Elemental Command									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Three times per day, the weird can summon forth 2d4 huge elementals, 1d2 greater elementals, or 1 elder elemental through this portal. Any nonelemental creature entering a pool without the weird's permission must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 20) each round or be irrevocably transformed into the elemental material of the pool. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird are not subject to transformation. However, creatures allowed to enter a pool must still provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment.Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cloud ray can swallow a snatched opponent that is Huge or smaller by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +61). The cloud ray, however, has no appreciable stomach. Instead it has a long throat, the whole length of which is equipped with teeth for grinding and tearing food. Its throat empties directly into its intestines, so the ray must chew its food thoroughly to ensure proper digestion. Once inside the ray's throat, the opponent takes 3d10+22 points of bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage per round from its teeth and muscular contractions. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the throat and return to the ray's mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the throat (AC 12) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A cloud ray's throat can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.	KEY:Cloud Ray ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Levitate	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The cloud ray controls its altitude by generating and manipulating lighter-than-air gases inside its body. This ability enables it to ascend 20 feet per round or, by neutralizing the levitating gases and letting gravity take its course, descend as much as 500 feet per round. In spite of its immense bulk, the ray can pull out of such a dive instantly simply by levitating again.	KEY:Cloud Ray ~ Levitate																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Protection from Arrows	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:This ability allows a cloud ray to resist most ranged attacks.

KEY:Cloud Ray ~ Protection from Arrows																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Telekinesis	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Lacking any sort of hands or paws, the cloud ray instead uses telekinesis to manipulate objects. This ability works like the telekinesis spell (caster level 5th), so the creature can lift or throw 125 pounds.	KEY:Cloud Ray ~ Telekinesis																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Skills	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudRayRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Thanks to its coloration, a cloud ray has a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks. *When it tires of drifting through the sky, it settles to the ground for rest. Through a combination of telekinesis and moving its great wing-flaps, it covers itself with dust, dirt, rocks, logs, uprooted bushes, and whatever else is nearby. While it is thus camouflaged, its Hide modifier rises to +32. The ray may rest on the ground thus covered for a few hours or a few weeks.

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a corpse gatherer hits an opponent its own size or smaller with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +39). If it gets a hold, it can try to swallow the opponent in the next round. Alternatively, the corpse gatherer has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its hand to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the corpse gatherer is not considered grappled). In either case, its next successful grapple check deals automatic slam damage.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Ingest Corpses	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The corpse gatherer increases its hit points by adding bodies to its form. It gains 5 hit points for every corpse of a swallowed creature that it absorbs. The corpse gatherer can exceed its normal hit points in this manner, gaining any excess as temporary hit points.Opponents the creature has swallowed are not subject to ingestion until the round after they die.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Ingest Corpses																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A corpse gatherer can swallow a grabbed opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +39). The creature need not use its mouth to swallow; it can merely stuff the opponent into any convenient portion of its porous body. Once inside the gatherer, the opponent takes 1d12+12 points of bludgeoning damage per round from the roiling corpses, gravestones, and other objects inside the creature's body. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to extract itself from the hands of the corpses inside the gatherer and return to the surface of the gatherer's body, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the corpse gatherer (AC 14) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, the other nearby corpses close the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan corpse gatherer can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32Mediumsize, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Desanctifying Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A corpse gatherer projects a continual field of negative energy in a 100-foot-radius emanation. The area within this field is under the effect of a double-strength desecrate spell (caster level 15th), as if the corpse gatherer were a permanent feature dedicated to its own deity. Each turning attempt within this area has a -6 profane penalty. Further, each undead creature in the area (including the corpse gatherer) is entitled to a +2 profane bonus on its attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws, as well as +2 hit points per HD. This aura lasts for 24 hours after the corpse gatherer has passed through.

Soul Binding	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Creatures slain and ingested by a corpse gatherer are affected as if by a soul bind spell, so they cannot be restored to life. Destroying the corpse gatherer negates this effect. Corpses that the creature devours without having slain them itself are not subject to soul binding.	KEY:Corpse Gatherer ~ Soul Binding																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Zombie Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseGathererRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Upon reaching 0 hit points, the corpse gatherer falls apart into its component corpses. The creature's animating force remains among the corpses that formerly composed its body, converting them into zombies. Upon its death, a corpse gatherer generates as many zombies as it has Hit Dice (that is, a 30-HD corpse-gatherer becomes thirty zombies). Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, these are allMedium-size zombies.They function normally as long as they remain in the desanctified area of the dead corpse gatherer, but outside its effect they revert to normal corpses.

Each round thereafter that the opponent remains seized, the creature automatically deals an additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The crimson death craves blood, so it usually presses its attack until it can deal at least 12 points of Constitution damage.	KEY:Crimson Death ~ Blood Drain																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Seize	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrimsonDeathRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When a crimson death makes a successful incorporeal touch attack, one of its tendrils wraps around the opponent.

A darktentacles's tentacles have 20 hit points. If the darktentacles is currently grappling a target with that tentacle, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity against the sunder attempt.

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DinosaurSpinosaurusRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Spinosaurus can swallow a grabbed opponent that is at least two size categories smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +40). Once inside the gullet, the opponent takes 2d8+10 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8+4 points of acid damage per round from the dinosaur's digestive juices. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the gullet and return to the mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the digestive tract (AC 14) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan spinosaurus's gullet can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium-size, 32 Small, or 128 Tiny or smaller opponents.	KEY:Dinosaur (Spinosaurus) ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

The effects of infusion on the opponent are similar to those of a magic jar spell, except as noted here. Upon infusion, the effigy gains control of the infused creature. While infused, it uses the body's physical ability scores but its own mental ability scores. It also uses whatever attack forms the subject has available. Such attacks still do 2d6 points of additional fire damage, but they do not bestow negative levels. An infused effigy automatically deals fire damage and inflicts energy drain on its host body each round. The subject dies upon reaching -10 hit points or dropping below 1st level. At that point, the body becomes a flaming corpse. Each round after infusion occurs, the subject must make an opposed Wisdom check against the effigy. Success casts the effigy out, forcing it to retreat 30 feet. Thereafter, it may not attempt to infuse the same target again for 1 round per point of difference between the check results. A failed save leaves the effigy in control of the body. If an effigy is turned while infused in a host, it abandons the body to flee.|EffigyDC	KEY:Effigy ~ Infuse				DEFINE:EffigyDC|0					BONUS:VAR|EffigyDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|EffigyDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Infuse)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Infuse									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Assume Identity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DoppelgangerEtherealRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An ethereal doppelganger can absorb another creature's mind, memories, and personality. This process requires 1 hour of unbroken physical contact per level or Hit Die of the subject. The target may attempt a Will save (DC %1); if that is successful, the process is negated and the ethereal doppelganger must begin again. A willing creature can choose to waive the saving throw. After consuming the target creature's identity, the ethereal doppelganger can assume its form with 100%% accuracy. The doppelganger possesses the other creature's memories, plus its alignment and all of its abilities, except for cleric spells of 2nd level or higher, a paladin's special abilities, and other powers granted by deities. (This does not deprive the subject of those memories or abilities; it only duplicates them in the ethereal doppelganger). The doppelganger retains its own damage resistance, darkvision, fast healing, and spell resistance in its new form. If an ethereal doppelganger commits an act that runs counter to its new identity's alignment, it is immediately forced back into its natural form for 1d10 rounds. It still retains the basic memories of the assumed identity, though not the deeper memories. If the subject dies before the contract is complete, the ethereal doppelganger immediately reverts to its natural form and loses all of that subject's memories and abilities.|AssumeIdentityDC	KEY:Doppelganger (Ethereal) ~ Assume Identity				DEFINE:AssumeIdentityDC|0					BONUS:VAR|AssumeIdentityDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|AssumeIdentityDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Assume Identity)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Assume Identity									SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Brain Lock	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DoppelgangerEtherealRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, an ethereal doppelganger can lock away the higher mind of an opponent up to 300 feet away, provided both are on the same plane and the doppelganger has line of sight to its subject. A successful Will save (DC %1) negates the attempt; failure leaves the subject mentally paralyzed. A brain-locked creature is not stunned, so attackers get no special advantage against it. Furthermore, it can still defend itself against attacks (its Dexterity bonus to AC, if any, still applies), but it cannot move or initiate any actions. A brain lock can negate various forms of special movement and cause harm to the creature thereby. For example, a brain-locked flying creature falls because it cannot flap its wings, and a brain-locked swimming creature may drown because it can no longer move its limbs. The effect lasts 20 rounds, but it can be dismissed earlier.|AssumeIdentityDC	KEY:Doppelganger (Ethereal) ~ Brain Lock				DEFINE:BrainLockDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BrainLockDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|BrainLockDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Brain Lock)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Brain Lock									SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FiendwurmRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a fiendwurm hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +49). If it gets a hold, it can try to swallow the opponent in the next round. Alternatively, the fiendwurm has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its jaws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the fiendwurm is not considered grappled).

Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:FiendwurmRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A fiendwurm can swallow a grabbed opponent that is at least two size categories smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +49). Once inside the fiendwurm, the opponent takes 2d8+13 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d8 points of acid damage per round from the creature's gizzard. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the gizzard and return to the fiendwurm's mouth, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 20) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan fiendwurm's gizzard can hold 2Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or 128 Small or smaller creatures.	KEY:Fiendwurm ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2

Each creature in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC %1) or be pinned, automatically taking 2d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage.

These temporary hit points fade 1d6 rounds after the creature ceases physical contact with the glimmerskin. However, this benefit has an unfortunate side effect. For each round that its hit points (including temporary ones) exceed its normal hit point total, the target creature must make a successful Fortitude save (DC %1) or explode in a 20-foot burst of radiant energy. Each creature caught in the blast (including the target) takes damage equal to 2d6 points + the number of excess hit points the target had at the time. A Reflex save (DC %1) reduces the damage by half. A glimmerskin's host automatically benefits from the additional hit points but is allowed no saving throw to reduce the damage from the blast.

Every creature within the area must make a Fortitude save (DC %1) each round or take 1d2 points of Constitution damage.

Death Fog	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreenviseRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Twice per day, a greenvise can emit an acidic fog that functions like an acid fog spell, except as follows. The death fogs area is a 40-foot high spread with a 60-foot radius. Within this area, all sight, including darkvision, is limited to 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has onehalf concealment (attacks against it have a 20%% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50%% miss chance, and the attacker cant use sight to locate the target). Any creature attempting to move through the death fog progresses at one-tenth normal speed, and each of its melee attack and melee damage rolls incurs a 2 circumstance penalty. A death fog prevents effective ranged weapon attacks, except for magic rays and the like. In addition to obscuring sight, a death fog is highly acidic. Each round, the fog deals 3d8 points of acid damage to every creature and object within it (no saving throw). A severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors in 1d2 rounds; otherwise, the effect lasts for 3d6+1 rounds. The greenvise is not impeded by its own death fog, so it can move and fight within the fog freely.	KEY:Gravecrawler ~ Death Fog																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Improved Grab	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreenviseRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Improved Grab	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:If a greenvise hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +26). If it gets a hold, it can transfer the opponent to its maw with another successful grapple check, dealing automatic bite damage, then try to swallow in the next round. Alternatively, the greenvise has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tendrils or maw to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the greenvise is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals slam or bite damage, as appropriate.	KEY:Gravecrawler ~ Improved Grab																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2	
Swallow Whole	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GreenviseRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A greenvise can swallow a single creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +26), provided it already has that opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the greenvise, the opponent takes 2d6+9 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d4 points of acid damage per round from the plants stomach. A successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the greenvises maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing at least 20 points of damage to the stomach (AC 14) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A greenvises stomach can hold 1 Large, 4 Medium-size, 16 Small, or 64 Tiny or smaller opponents. 	KEY:Gravecrawler ~ Swallow Whole																											SOURCEPAGE:MM2
