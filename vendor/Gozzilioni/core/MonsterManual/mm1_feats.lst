If the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking creature's choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the attacking creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

Flyby Attack	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																			PREMOVE:1,Fly=1			DESC:When flying, the creature can take a move action (including a dive) and another standard action at any point during the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a round when it makes a flyby attack.																	SOURCEPAGE:MM1		
Hover	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																			PREMOVE:1,Fly=1			DESC:When flying, the creature can halt its forward motion and hover in place as a move action. It can then fly in any direction, including straight down or straight up, at half speed, regardless of its maneuverability. If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place for the turn and take a full-round action. A hovering creature cannot make wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and appendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead use a breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if it could normally do so. If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20 feet (20%% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50%% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature). Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 creature's HD) to cast a spell.																	SOURCEPAGE:MM1

Snatch	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																			PRESIZEGTEQ:H			DESC:The creature can choose to start a grapple when it hits with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the improved grab special attack. If the creature gets a hold on a creature three or more sizes smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw damage. A snatched opponent held in the creature's mouth is not allowed a Reflex save against the creature's breath weapon, if it has one. The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free action or use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 1d6x10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled. If the creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the opponent takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.																	SOURCEPAGE:MM1
