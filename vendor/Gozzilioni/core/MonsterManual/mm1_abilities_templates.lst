Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50%% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently.

Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.	KEY:Ghost ~ Draining Touch																											SOURCEPAGE:MM1			
Frightful Moan	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostRaceTrait.GhostSpecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save DC %1 or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind- ffecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours.|FrightfoulMoanDC	KEY:Ghost ~ Frightful Moan				DEFINE:FrightfoulMoanDC|0					BONUS:VAR|FrightfoulMoanDC|GhostAbilityDC	BONUS:VAR|FrightfoulMoanDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Frightful Moan)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Frightful Moan									SOURCEPAGE:MM1

Malevolence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostRaceTrait.GhostSpecialAttack.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost's Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body.	KEY:Ghost ~ Malevolence																											SOURCEPAGE:MM1

Rejuvenation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhostRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research.	KEY:Ghost ~ Rejuvenation																											SOURCEPAGE:MM1

If the vampire instead drains the victim's Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. At any given time a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.

Energy Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampireRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Living creatures hit by a vampire's slam attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels.

Alternate Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampireRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to a polymorph spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the vampire does not regain hit points for changing form and must choose from among the forms mentioned here. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms).

Fast Healing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampireRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.	KEY:Vampire ~ Fast Healing																											SOURCEPAGE:MM1
