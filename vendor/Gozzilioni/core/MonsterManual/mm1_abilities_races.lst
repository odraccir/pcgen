Corporeal Instability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ChaosBeastRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must succeed on a DC %1 Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is Constitution-based. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried armor, backpacks, even shirts-hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50%% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast. A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful. Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove. A shapechange or stoneskin spell does not cure an afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes the affliction (a separate restoration is necessary to restore any drained points of Wisdom).|CorporealInstabilityDC	KEY:Chaos Beast ~ Corporeal Instability				DEFINE:CorporealInstabilityDC|0					BONUS:VAR|CorporealInstabilityDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|CorporealInstabilityDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Corporeal Instability)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Corporeal Instability									SOURCEPAGE:MM1
