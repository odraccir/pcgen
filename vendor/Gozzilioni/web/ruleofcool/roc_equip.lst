Coffin of Unrest		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous	COST:100	WT:10	SOURCEPAGE:ROC	SPROP:This item was first developed as a way of carrying the dead bodies of massive creatures out of dungeons into wizard labs and city markets, but quickly found use as a way of adventuring Ghosts protecting their own corpses. It has the size of a regular human coffin, but can hold the corpse of any dead creature and protects it from enviromental harm, regardless of size. The coffin also always weights only 10 pounds, regardless of carrying an halfling body or a dragon carcass. It has Hardness 5 and 20 HP, blocks ethereal travel, and comes with a Lock that is immune to Knock and can be opened with a DC 20 Lockpick check. It can also be fited with regular chains to the back of a carrier as a backpack, not taking a magic item slot (a magic backpack may be fited on top or side of the coffin). The Coffin of Unrest cannot be closed if there's any living creatures inside, or items not equiped on the corpse, and its contents will spill out as soon as it is moved in any way.
Lock (Seal of the Dead)		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous	COST:1000	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:ROC	SPROP:This set of plates and runes strenghtens a coffin based on the body of who's inside. Its hardness increases by 1, its HP increases by 5 and its open DC increases by 1 for every HD of the one resting inside.
