Gene Devour	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DeepspawnMotherClassFeature.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a fullround action, a Deepspawn can hungrily eat a dead body of its own size or smaller (bigger bodies can be quickly eaten by spending one extra round for each size category bigger). It  then stores all of the genetic information about that creature, altough the Deepsawn itself cannot directly acess it.

Spawn Child	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DeepspawnMotherClassFeature.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Deepspawn are infamous horrors that give birth to many other types of monsters, such that a single deepspawn can make a large area perilous to even alert, well-armed adventurers. By some yet unexplained, natural means, deepspawn can grow and give birth to any creature that it has sucessfully used Gene Devour with, as long as it has less HD than Deepspawn levels (so at first level the Deepspawn is limited to creatures with less than 1 HD like cats and sparrows).	KEY:Deepspawn Mother ~ Spawn Child																											SOURCEPAGE:ROC
Favorite Child	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DeepspawnMotherClassFeature.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 3rd level when the Deepspawn gives birth to a Spawn Child, it may whisper them sweet words and praise that make them loyally fanatic to the Deepspawn. It will now follow it and obey its orders as a cohort. Only one Favorite Child at a time, any attempt to have simultaneous ones will always end up in murderous sibling jealously.

Treasure Dungeon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DeepspawnMotherClassFeature.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 4th level the Deepspawn gains Hoard as a bonus feat.

Early Birth	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DeepspawnMotherClassFeature.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 5th level the Deepspawn can acelerate the gestation of a Spawn Child growing inside its body to be instantly born as a fullround action. It  is completely ready for action as normal, but will then die in 1d4 minutes because it wasn't properly formed. In this case, the body also instantly decays in useless mulch as soon as it dies, even if killed by something else before. Once Early Birth is used, the Deepspawn must wait 1 hour before starting to grow a new Spawn Child. The Deepspawn may attempt to use Early Birth multiple times per day, but each extra one forces it to make a Fort save with DC 10+2 per Early Birth performed in the last 24 hours. If it fails, it is left Exhausted and Nauseated for 1 round and cannot start growing a new Spawn Child for 24 hours.	KEY:Deepspawn Mother ~ Early Birth																											SOURCEPAGE:ROC
Mother of All Monsters	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DeepspawnMotherClassFeature.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 8th level the Deepspawn reaches its true potential. It now uses all of its HD instead of just Deepspawn levels for determining what creatures it can spawn. In addition it may start mixing genes of the creatures it has eaten to produce hybrids. This allows the deepspawn to mix levels, feats and skill points from two creatures it has eaten, as long as the final result is a "legal" build. The Deepspawn may swap the creature's feats for Monster Blood and Monster Hybrid as needed to combine diferent monster classes. In alternative, it may produce actual hybrid races if it has both "component monsters". So an human and orc could be combined into an half-orc, or a red dragon and ogre could be combined into an half-red-dragon ogre. The Deepspawn cannot however further mix in genes obtained from such hybrids, even if they were produced by another Deepspawn.

In it are scribed the terms of the contract in amazing detail. The Erinyes always retains a copy of the contract and, if pressed, provides a second one to the signatory. Mortals must sign in their own blood to render the contract binding.

The effect persists for 24 hours or until the target creature is affected by a dispel chaos. Until the gift expires or is removed, the affected creature radiates chaos as if his alignment were chaotic. Moreover, its natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. As long as the character possesses the gift, the lilitu's name (written in Abyssal) appears as a tattoo somewhere on the character's body. Most lilitu take pains to place this mark somewhere that's easily hidden. The recipient of a lilitu's gift cannot see his own tattoo. As long as the gift remains active, the lilitu can monitor the character's condition and location as if she had placed a status spell on that character. She can communicate telepathically with the character at all times, despite any intervening distance (even across planes), and by concentrating can observe the world around the character as if she were there in his place. Lilitus often use this ability to influence and trick a character into performing chaotic or evil acts. Accepting a lilitu's gift is a chaotic act and could have repercussions on the recipient's alignment. It is also a supernatural ability.&nl;A creature can resist gaining a lilitu's gift by making a DC %1 Will save.|LilituSGiftDC	KEY:Lilitu ~ Lilitu's Gift				DEFINE:LilituSGiftDC|0					BONUS:VAR|LilituSGiftDC|DefaultDCCha	BONUS:VAR|LilituSGiftDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Lilitu's Gift)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Lilitu's Gift									SOURCEPAGE:ROC
