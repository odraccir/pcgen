Hoard	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monster	VISIBLE:YES																						DESC:Benefit: As an 8 hour process, you may declare an empty space consisting of one 30x30 feet cube per HD, all of which must be connected with at least another one, as your Hoard Vault. You can count any non-expendable non-weapon non-shield magic items you leave in your Hoard Vault as if you had equiped them wherever you go, altough this doesn't allow you to go over the usual number of body slots. So if you leave two suits of magic armor, you can only count yourself as wearing one of them. Changing "equiped" Hoard Vault items takes as many time as physically swaping them would, except you spend the time focusing in your connection with your treasure. In addition, you can have piles of money, jewelery and other similar non-magic shiny riches provide you extra benefits, depending on their worth. Each pile of non-magic treasure can only be invested in one kind of bonus at a time. Changing those demands spending 8 hour in your hoard carefully attuning to it (or simply rolling and sleeping over it).&nl;Enhanched Body - The dust of jewels and precious metals sharpens your claws and toughens your scales. You gain an enhancement bonus to your natural weaopons and natural armor. They always count as magic whenever it would be benefical for you and the enhancement bonus to your natural armor counts towards your touch AC as well. 7,000 gp (+1), 29,000 gp (+2), 63,000 gp (+3), 112,000 gp (+4), 175,000 gp.&nl;Status Symbol - Only a mighty monster can hold a mighty hoard, so your riches clearly reflect your natural prowess. You gain an enhancement bonus bonus to two ability scores of your choice. 6,000 gp (+2), 24,000 gp (+4), 54,000 gp (+6). The bonus granted by your Hoard cannot be dispelled, disarmed, sundered or similar, but removing the actual items from your hoard will, and AMF and similar effects also stop you from receiving your hoard's benefits. Your character doesn't automatically realize something is amiss, until they're forced into a combat situation You must rest at least 8 hours per week on the top of your Hoard to gain the above benefits. Special: A true dragon can gain hoard as a bonus feat simply by devouring 2000 GP worth of treasure.																	SOURCEPAGE:ROC
