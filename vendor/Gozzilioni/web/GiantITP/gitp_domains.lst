You gain a +4 sacred (or profane if you are Evil) bonus on Balance checks on moving surfaces (for example, standing on a horse's back, on a boat, a rolling log, or an iceberg).

When walking through heavy snow (DMG 94), you can enter a square by spending half the normal amount of movement (2 squares instead of the normal 4). In addition, you do not leave a more readily discernible trail through snow; creatures attempting to track you through snow do so as if you had been walking on solid ground instead.
