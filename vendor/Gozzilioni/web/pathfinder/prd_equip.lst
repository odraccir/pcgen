###Basic Equipment Object to be modified.												
Tattoo	TYPE:Tattoo	COST:0	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	MODS:REQUIRED	SPROP:The price of a tattoo depends on the quality, size, and number of colors used. A coin-sized tattoo in blue ink that will blur over a decade costs 1 cp, a hand-sized one in black ink that won't fade costs 1 sp, and a tattoo covering an entire back takes several sessions and costs 10 gp. Each additional color costs as much as a single tattoo of its size. While these prices represent the baseline, tattoos-like any other artwork-can be worth far more depending on the prestige of the artist.						
												
###Block:Trap												
Bear Trap	TYPE:Trap.Mechanical	COST:2	WT:10	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Although intended for trapping large animals, bear traps work as well for trapping humanoids or monsters. The hinged jaws of the trap are attached to a chain, which in turn is secured to a spike driven into the ground to ensure that the victim cannot simply crawl away. Prying open the jaws or pulling the spike from the ground requires a DC 20 Strength check.

###Block:Alchemical												
Antidote Kit	TYPE:Goods.Tools	COST:100	WT:3	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This small box contains a wide variety of remedies and treatments against not only specific poisons but also their most common methods of delivery, including such things as purgatives to eliminate ingested toxins. It grants a +3 circumstance bonus on Heal checks made to treat poison. An antidote kit is exhausted after 10 uses.	EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_10|CHARGES[10]						
Alchemical Grease (Flask)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Flask.Consumable.Liquid	COST:5	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Each pot of this slick black goo has sufficient contents to cover one Medium creature or two Small ones. If you coat yourself in alchemical grease, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on Escape Artist checks, on combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to your CMD to avoid being grappled; this lasts 4 hours or until you wash it off.	TEMPBONUS:ANYPC|SKILL|Escape Artist|5|TYPE=Alchemical						
Alchemist's Kindness	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:1	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Favored by young rakes and other well-to-do inebriates, this crystalline powder resembles salt. Mixed with water, it makes a fizzing cocktail that eliminates the effects of a hangover within 10 minutes of drinking it.							
Antiplague (Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Consumable.Liquid	COST:50	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:If you drink a vial of this foul-tasting, milky tonic, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease for the next hour. If already infected, you may also make two saving throws (without the +5 bonus) that day and use the better result.	TEMPBONUS:ANYPC|SAVE|Fortitude|5|TYPE=Alchemical						
Bladeguard	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:40	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This clear resin protects a weapon from harmful attacks made by oozes and rust monsters, as well as from similar effects that corrode or melt weapons, rendering the weapon immune for 24 hours. One pot can coat one two-handed weapon, two one-handed or light weapons, or 50 ammunition items. Applying it takes 1 full round per pot. Immersing the weapon in water or similar liquid washes it off.							
Fire Ward Gel	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:150	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from fire or heat damage. You gain fire resistance 5. The gel burns away as it absorbs fire damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of fire damage, it is discharged. Fire ward gel counts as protection from energy for the purpose of stacking multiple fire protection effects. Applying fire ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of fire ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of fire damage absorbed to 20 points.							
Frost Ward Gel	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:150	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from cold damage. You gain cold resistance 5. The gel flakes away as it absorbs cold damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of cold damage, it is discharged. Frost ward gel counts as protection from energy for the purpose of stacking multiple cold protection effects. Applying frost ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of frost ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of cold damage absorbed to 20 points.							
Meditation Tea	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:30	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Drinking this cloudy tea has a soothing effect that clarifies your thoughts. For 10 minutes after drinking the tea, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus against mind-affecting effects. If you drink meditation tea while suffering from a mind-affecting affect, you may immediately roll another saving throw (with the +2 bonus) against the effect; you may gain this particular benefit only once per day.							
Padzahr	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:80	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Drinking this crystal-clear liquid accelerates the natural process of healing Constitution damage. Resting for 1 hour after drinking a vial heals you of 1 point of Constitution damage as if you had benefited from a full night's rest. Taking multiple doses in an hour does not increase the rate of healing; you must take each individually, followed by an hour of rest, for it to have any effect. Using more than 4 doses of padzahr in 1 day has no effect.							
Smelling Salt	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:25	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These sharply scented gray crystals cause people inhaling them to regain consciousness. Smelling salts grant you a new saving throw to resist any spell or effect that has already rendered you unconscious or staggered. If exposed to smelling salts while dying, you immediately become conscious and staggered, but must still make stabilization checks each round; if you perform any standard action (or any other strenuous action), you take 1 point of damage after completing the act and fall unconscious again. A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left open.							
Soothe Syrup (Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Liquid.Consumable	COST:25	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This sweet and wholesome-tasting blue liquid creates a sense of warmth and comfort. Soothe syrup coats your stomach and makes it much more difficult for you to succumb to queasiness. For 1 hour after drinking soothe syrup, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on saving throws made to resist effects that would make you nauseated or sickened.							
Soul Stimulant	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:300	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This soothing elixir was created to counter the energy-draining effects of vampires, wights, and similar horrible creatures. If you have a negative level (whether temporary or permanent), you can drink a dose of soul stimulant, negating the negative level's penalty for 12 hours. You can only benefit from 1 dose of soul stimulant at a time, though you can continue to take a dose every 12 hours to stave off the negative level's effects.							
Troll Oil	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:50	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This crimson liquid is viscous and tastes foul. If you drink it, for the next hour you automatically stabilize when reduced to negative hit points (unless the damage is sufficient to instantly kill you) and have a 50% chance each round to end any bleed effect on you. If you take fire or acid damage, the benefits of troll oil are suspended for 1 round.							
Twitch Tonic	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:45	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This thick syrup is extracted from bitter herbs and enhanced by alchemy to ward against sleep, paralysis, and the staggered condition. If you drink twitch tonic, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws made against these effects for the next hour. If you drink twitch tonic while suffering from any of these effects, you may immediately roll another saving throw against the effect (with the +2 bonus); you may gain this particular benefit only once per day. You can administer twitch tonic to an unconscious or paralyzed creature as a full-round action, similar to administering a potion.							
Vermin Repellent	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Jar.Consumable	COST:5	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This vile-smelling white paste keeps vermin at bay if spread on your skin. Normal-sized (Fine) vermin avoid you. Swarms of vermin must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude saving throw in order to enter your square. Vermin repellent has no adverse effect on vermin of Small size or larger, though if an attacking vermin has a choice of targets that are respectively covered and not covered in repellent, it usually chooses the creatures without repellent. Once applied, vermin repellent remains effective for 4 hours or until you spend 1 round washing it off.							
Wismuth Salix	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:30	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This pink liquid has a horrible chalky taste, but is quite effective at counteracting nausea, indigestion, and diarrhea. A vial of wismuth salix, taken in small doses during the day, alleviates these symptoms. If you drink an entire vial of wismuth salix, for 1 hour you get a +2 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against effects that inflict the nauseated or sickened condition. If you drink a vial of it while suffering from the nauseated or sickened condition, you may immediately roll another saving throw (with the +2 bonus) against the effect; you may gain this particular benefit only once per day. Drinking a vial of wismuth salix (whether over the course of a day or all at once) usually turns your tongue black for about a day, though this is a harmless side effect.							
Alchemical Cement	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:5	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:You mix this fine gray powder with water and a cubic foot of sand or gravel to form a durable stone-like material. Until it cures, it has the consistency of thick mud, and you must hold it in place (typically with a frame of earth or wood) if you want it to harden in a specific shape. It takes 1d10+10 minutes for the cement to partially cure, gaining hardness 2 and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. After 1d6 hours the cement is fully cured and as hard as true stone.							
Alchemical Glue	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Flask.Consumable	COST:20	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This glue is stored as two flasks of syrupy liquid. When mixed together and allowed to cure, they form a strong bond. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste, spills, and inaccurate mixing) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. The glue is tacky after 1 minute and fully cured after 1 hour. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 20 Strength check for tacky glue or DC 25 for cured glue. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) is a DC 15 Strength check for tacky glue or DC 20 for cured glue.							
Alchemical Glue Accelerant	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Consumable	COST:25	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This tiny dropper contains a liquid that speeds up the cure time of alchemical glue. Applying the accelerant is a standard action. Accelerated glue is tacky after 1 round and fully cured in 1 minute. The dropper contains 20 doses; each dose is sufficient to cure one small application of alchemical glue. The entire dropper must be used to cure a full square foot of glue.	EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_20|CHARGES[20]						
Alchemical Glue Solvent	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Consumable	COST:20	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This bubbling purple gel eats through adhesives. Each vial can cover a single 5-foot square. It destroys most normal adhesives (such as tar, tree sap, or glue) in a single round but takes 1d4+1 rounds to deal with more powerful adhesives (alchemical glue, tanglefoot bags, spider webbing, and so on). It has no affect on fully magical adhesives, such as sovereign glue.							
Armor Ointment	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Consumable	COST:30	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This thick lubricant makes the joints of armor move more freely. Applying the ointment takes 1 minute and reduces your armor's armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of -1) for 8 hours.							
Blackfire Clay	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Jar.Consumable	COST:20	WT:10	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This pliant black clay is always pleasantly warm to the touch. Working blackfire clay in your hands for a full round causes the clay to grow much warmer, granting you a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws made to resist cold weather. You can combine five blocks of clay over the course of a minute to produce a source of warmth equivalent to a small campfire, allowing you to heat a campsite and cook food. Blackfire clay only produces heat, never light, smoke, or odor. The clay emits warmth for 1 hour before hardening into an unusable lump. A newly created brick of blackfire clay is composed of 10 blocks.	EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_10|CHARGES[10]						
Bloodblock (Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Consumable	COST:25	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This gooey, pinkish substance helps treat wounds. Using a dose gives you a +5 alchemical bonus on Heal checks for providing first aid, treating wounds made by caltrops or similar objects, or treating deadly wounds. A dose of bloodblock ends a bleed effect as if you had made a DC 15 Heal check. When treating deadly wounds, using a dose of bloodblock counts as one use of a healer's kit (and grants the +5 bonus stated above).	BONUS:SKILL|Heal|5|TYPE=Alchemical	EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_10|CHARGES[10]					
Buoyant Ballon	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable	COST:10	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This fist-sized alchemically treated animal bladder is tightly sealed around a small wooden grip. By giving the handle a sharp twist you break a tiny glass ampoule just inside the bladder, filling the bag with buoyant gas and causing it to swell into a 3-foot-diameter sphere. Inflating the balloon is a move action. Once filled, the balloon floats upward at a speed of 60 feet per round. The balloon can lift up to 20 pounds of weight as it rises, though carrying more than 10 pounds reduces its speed to 30 feet per round. Multiple balloons attached to a single object add their carrying capacities together when determining how much weight they can lift. If a balloon is not held or bound in place in some manner, it continues to rise until it reaches a height of 600 feet, or until 10 minutes have passed, after which it pops or deflates and is destroyed.							
Candlerod	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable.LightSource	COST:1	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Similar to but weaker than a sunrod, this stick glows like a candle when struck and lasts for 12 hours.	QUALITY:Shadowy Illumination|5 ft.	QUALITY:Duration|12 hr.					
Casting Plaster	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:0.5	WT:5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This white, dry powder mixes with water to form a paste, which hardens over the course of an hour to create a solid material. It can be used to make casts of footprints or carvings, fill in gaps or cracks in walls, or (if applied over a cloth wrapping) create a cast for a broken bone. Hardened plaster has hardness 1 and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. A 5-pound clay pot of plaster can cover about 5 square feet of flat space to a depth of 1 inch, five Medium forearm or lower-leg casts, two Medium full-arm or full-leg casts, or twice as many casts for a Small creature.							
Chill Cream	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Jar.Consumable	COST:15	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This sticky light blue paste grows pleasantly cool to the touch whenever it is exposed to light. Spreading a dose on your face and hands takes a full-round action and grants you a +2 alchemical bonus on saves to resist hot weather. In areas of bright light this bonus increases to +4, while in areas of dim light or darkness it is negated. A dose of chill cream lasts for 1 hour after being applied. A newly crafted bottle of chill cream holds 5 doses.	EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_5|CHARGES[5]						
Defoliant (Flask)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Flask.Liquid.Consumable	COST:30	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This milky fluid can be mixed with water to quickly kill light and medium vegetation. One flask of defoliant kills light brush and small trees in 50 5-foot squares. Light vegetation (anything but trees) dies within 1 hour and can be cleared at a rate of 10 minutes per 5-foot square (representing uprooting dead plants and breaking stumps into gravel-sized pieces), leaving barren ground. Medium vegetation (anything but massive trees) dies in 2 hours and can be cleared at a rate of 1 hour per 5-foot square. Massive trees can usually survive a single dose of defoliant, and using defoliant doesn't make clearing them any easier. Defoliant can be used as a splash weapon against plant creatures. A direct hit with the undiluted fluid deals 1d6 hit points of damage, 1 point of Strength damage, and 1 point of Constitution damage (Fortitude DC 20 negates the Strength and Constitution damage); plant creatures within 5 feet of the target take 1 hit point of damage.	EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_5|CHARGES[5]						
Embalming Fluid	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:50	WT:10	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This fluid is used to preserve corpses, whether for later dissection, taxidermy, necromancy, or magic such as raise dead. Embalming fluid is technically a poison, and using it makes a corpse unpalatable to most animals and vermin, though corpse-eating undead don't mind the taste. Treating a corpse with embalming fluid takes 1 hour and a successful DC 25 Heal check. The embalmed corpse decays at half the normal rate (each day dead counts as half a day for the purpose of raise dead).							
Foaming Powder	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:10	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:When you add this 1-pound bag of green powder to a gallon of water, the two combine to form 50 cubic feet of thick green foam. Unless contained, in 1 round the foam fills a 5-foot-square to a depth of 2 feet. When multiple pounds of powder are used, the foam expands at a rate of one 5-foot square per round. Ground covered with the foam is treated as difficult terrain, but is otherwise harmless. After 1 hour, the foam hardens to form a buoyant material roughly the density of honeycomb. The cured foam is easy to cut, with hardness 0 and 5 hit points per foot of thickness. The cured foam breaks down over a few days, and even faster if exposed to water. Casting transmute mud to rock on uncured foam converts it into a soft, pumice-like stone (hardness 2, 5 hit points per inch of thickness).							
Ink (Glowing/Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Liquid.Consumable.Writing	COST:5	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Often extracted from phosphorescent insects, tiny marine plants, or subterranean fungi, glowing ink emits a faint but steady light (typically red or green) that allows you to read it in normal darkness-this includes darkness created by spells like darkness, but not the supernatural darkness created by deeper darkness. If there is glowing ink on an object, you have a +2 bonus on Perception checks to locate it. Mixing glowing ink with marker dye makes the dye glow in the dark until it fades. 							
Impact Foam	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Liquid.Consumable	COST:25	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This milky white liquid bubbles into a 1-foot-thick semisolid sheet of foam when splashed across the ground. You can spend a minute to apply a flask of impact foam to a 10-foot-radius area, or you can throw the flask as a splash weapon. The foam does not interfere with movement, but reacts strongly to sudden force. A creature that falls onto a sheet of impact foam ignores the first 1d6 points of falling damage and converts the second 1d6 points of falling damage into nonlethal damage. A sheet of impact foam dissolves after 10 minutes or when exposed to at least a gallon of water.							
Ink (Invisible/Simple/Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Liquid.Consumable.Writing	COST:2	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Invisible ink is a staple of spies, rebels, and secret societies everywhere. Messages written with invisible ink only become visible under specific circumstances. Revealing the secret message with the proper triggering agent is a full-round action per page of text. A successful Craft (alchemy) check reveals the message without the proper trigger and takes 1 hour (the DC varies by ink quality). This ink is keyed to a single, fairly common trigger, such as heat or vinegar (DC 20 to reveal without the trigger). 							
Ink (Invisible/Average/Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Liquid.Consumable.Writing	COST:10	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Invisible ink is a staple of spies, rebels, and secret societies everywhere. Messages written with invisible ink only become visible under specific circumstances. Revealing the secret message with the proper triggering agent is a full-round action per page of text. A successful Craft (alchemy) check reveals the message without the proper trigger and takes 1 hour (the DC varies by ink quality). This ink is keyed to either two common triggers or one uncommon trigger, such as blood or acid (DC 25 to reveal without the trigger).							
Ink (Invisible/Good/Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Liquid.Consumable.Writing	COST:25	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Invisible ink is a staple of spies, rebels, and secret societies everywhere. Messages written with invisible ink only become visible under specific circumstances. Revealing the secret message with the proper triggering agent is a full-round action per page of text. A successful Craft (alchemy) check reveals the message without the proper trigger and takes 1 hour (the DC varies by ink quality). This ink is keyed to either two uncommon triggers or one rare trigger, such as a specific vintage of wine or a specific kind of monster's blood (DC 30 to reveal without the trigger).							
Ink (Invisible/Superior/Vial)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Liquid.Consumable.Writing	COST:75	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Invisible ink is a staple of spies, rebels, and secret societies everywhere. Messages written with invisible ink only become visible under specific circumstances. Revealing the secret message with the proper triggering agent is a full-round action per page of text. A successful Craft (alchemy) check reveals the message without the proper trigger and takes 1 hour (the DC varies by ink quality). This ink is keyed to either two rare triggers or one unique trigger, such as the blood of a specific person (DC 35 to reveal without the trigger).							
Light Detector	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical	COST:1	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This hand-sized metal plate is covered with a thin layer of light-sensitive transparent paste. If exposed to light, the paste darkens and becomes opaque, depending on the amount of light. Bright light causes it to fully darken in 1 round, normal light in 3 rounds, and dim light in 10 rounds. It is mainly used by creatures with darkvision to determine whether creatures carrying light have recently passed through an area. The plate is sold wrapped in a thick black cloth to prevent accidental light exposure from ruining the plate.							
Dye (Marker)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical	COST:1	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This dye (available in several colors) creates an obvious stain wherever it is splashed. Washing has no effect for the first 72 hours (though magic can erase it), but it fades completely after 2 weeks. You can throw it as a splash weapon.							
Mending Paste (Flask)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Flask.Consumable	COST:25	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:You can use this smelly, silvery paste to temporarily repair metal objects. It is sold in a sealed flask and reacts with air, turning solid in 1d6+4 minutes. You must make an appropriate DC 20 Craft check to repair a metal item with the broken condition; success means the object loses the broken condition but gains the fragile condition (see page 22). Increase the DC by +5 if the broken object is a magic item or by +5 if it is a firearm (add both modifiers if the item is a magical firearm). If the check fails, the mending paste is consumed but you may try again with another flask or conventional repair methods.							
Nushadir	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Flask.Powder.Consumable	COST:10	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This reagent is often stored in the form of small, salty pellets in a dry container, though it can also be mixed with a flask of water and carried that way. Nushadir neutralizes acid; a vial of pellets or a flask of nushadir-water is enough to render a cubic foot of acid safe to touch in 1 minute, though this is usually too slow to prevent damage from a thrown vial of acid or the contents of a large monster's gullet. Nushadir vapors are slightly irritating to the eyes, nose, and mouth, causing nausea for 1d4 rounds after close exposure (Fortitude DC 10 negates). 							
Rusting Powder	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:60	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This flaky brown powder derived from rust monster fluids causes iron and similar metals to corrode and fall apart. If you apply a dose of rusting powder to a metal lock or trap as part of using the Disable Device skill, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus to open the lock or disable the trap, but there is a 75% chance that the mechanism is destroyed and cannot be used afterward. If the check fails, the mechanism is destroyed. A destroyed lock cannot be unlocked (but still counts as locked for the purpose opening the locked object). A destroyed trap mechanism immediately triggers the trap. If you fail the DC by 5 or more, the powder also lands on an object in your square (including possibly your armor or weapon), dealing 5 hit points of damage to the object.&nl;Rusting powder is sold in a paper tube; you apply it by tearing the ends off the tube and blowing the flakes into the target device. Rusting powder does not affect gold, silver, copper, bronze, brass, or mithral, but easily affects iron, steel, and adamantine.							
Scent Cloak	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:20	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This collection of coarsely ground spices, seeds, musk, and alchemical reagents are meant to be rubbed into your skin and clothes in order to override your scent, increasing the DC of tracking you by scent by +10 for 24 hours. Because you still have a smell, creatures with scent can still detect and pinpoint you if you are cloaked; they just can't identify your smell as something unique. Washing for 1 full round removes the scent cloak. 							
Smoke Pellet	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable	COST:25	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This small clay sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier. When you break the sphere, the substances mingle and fill a 5-foot square with a cloud of foul but harmless yellow smoke. The smoke pellet acts as a smokestick, except the smoke only lasts for 1 round before dispersing. You may throw a smoke pellet as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.							
Water Purification Sponge	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical	COST:25	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This fist-sized blue sponge absorbs up to 1 pint of water; squeezing the water out of the sponge filters and purifies it, making it safe for drinking, washing, and similar activities. Filling and emptying the sponge is a full-round action. The filtration is enough to remove mundane impurities and common diseases, but does nothing to protect against poisons, magic, and other exotic threats. Each sponge can cleanse 25 pints of water before deteriorating and becoming useless.							
Weapon Blanch (Adamantine)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:100	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These silver, alchemical powders have a gritty consistency, appearing at first glance to be simple metal shavings. When poured on a weapon and placed over a hot flame for a full round, however, they melt and form a temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the ability to bypass one kind of material-based damage reduction, such as adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The blanching remains effective until you make a successful attack with the weapon. Each dose of blanching can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made of one special material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit. 							
Weapon Blanch (Cold Iron)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:20	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These silver, alchemical powders have a gritty consistency, appearing at first glance to be simple metal shavings. When poured on a weapon and placed over a hot flame for a full round, however, they melt and form a temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the ability to bypass one kind of material-based damage reduction, such as adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The blanching remains effective until you make a successful attack with the weapon. Each dose of blanching can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made of one special material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit. 							
Weapon Blanch (Silver)	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Powder.Consumable	COST:5	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These silver, alchemical powders have a gritty consistency, appearing at first glance to be simple metal shavings. When poured on a weapon and placed over a hot flame for a full round, however, they melt and form a temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the ability to bypass one kind of material-based damage reduction, such as adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The blanching remains effective until you make a successful attack with the weapon. Each dose of blanching can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made of one special material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit. 							
												
###Block:Clothing												
Barbed Vest	TYPE:Goods.Shirt.Resizable	COST:10	WT:4	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Thin leather flaps keep the hundreds of tiny, fishhook-like needles dotting the surface of this black vest from harming you while you wear it. However, any creature that injures you with a natural or unarmed attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage. If a creature swallows you, it takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits you up, you escape, or you die (at which point the vest has sustained enough damage that it no longer serves as a threat). The vest can only be worn over light armor or no armor.							
Fake Footprint Shoes	TYPE:Goods.Boot.Resizable	COST:5	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These oversized shoes are worn over normal footwear. They create footprints or bootprints that look like those left by another creature. Each pair creates a specific type of footprint, such as tiger, orc, goblin, or ogre. When walking with these shoes, you may make a Survival check; the check result is the Survival DC for anyone trying to determine whether the tracks are what they appear to be.	SLOTS:2
Filter Hood	TYPE:Goods.Headgear	COST:10	WT:4	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This snug leather hood has built-in goggles and a filtration tube containing sponges. A filter hood uses your helm slot and imposes a -2 penalty on hearing- and sight-based Perception checks. While the sponges are moist, the hood grants you a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against inhaled poisons and other airborne attacks that require you to breathe them. Moistening the sponges with water is a standard action. The sponges dry out after 1d4x10 minutes and should be thoroughly rinsed after each use.							
Helmet Candle	TYPE:Goods.Headgear.Container	COST:2	WT:4	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This device consists of a helmet with a short, thin spike on top upon which a candle is stuck, freeing your hands for other tasks.	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Candle=1						
Goggles (Smoked)	TYPE:Goods.Eyewear	COST:10	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These spectacles have lenses made of smoked glass that help protect against creatures with gaze attacks. You are always treated as averting your gaze when dealing with gaze attacks, and you gain a +8 circumstance bonus on saving throws against visual-based attacks (any attack that a blind creature would be immune to). You take a -4 penalty on Perception checks while wearing the goggles, and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance).							
Swarmswuit	TYPE:Goods.Shirt	COST:20	WT:10	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These heavy and overlapping layers of clothing, coupled with a wide hat outfitted with a dense, veil-like netting around its brim, makes it all but impossible for Diminutive and Fine creatures to make physical contact with your body. Wearing a swarmsuit cuts your speed in half, but gives you DR 10/- against swarms of Fine creatures and DR 5/- against swarms of Diminutive creatures.	BONUS:MOVEMULT|TYPE.Walk|0.5						
Weapon Cord	TYPE:Goods.Bracer	COST:0.1	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Weapon cords are 2-foot-long leather straps that attach your weapon to your wrist. If you drop your weapon or are disarmed, you can recover it as a swift action, and it never moves any farther away from you than an adjacent square. However, you cannot switch to a different weapon without first untying the cord (a full-round action) or cutting it (a move action or an attack, hardness 0, 0 hit points). Unlike with a locked gauntlet, you can still use a hand with a weapon cord, though a dangling weapon may interfere with finer actions.	SLOTS:1						
Cleats	TYPE:Goods.Boot	COST:5	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Cleats reduce the penalty for walking over slick surfaces by 50%. For example, walking across ice normally costs 2 squares of movement (1 square plus a 1 square penalty) for every square of movement, but with cleats it costs only 1.5 squares for every square. Cleats cause damage to any type of finished flooring. They may supplement another outfit.	SLOTS:2
Outfit (Diving Suit)	TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable	COST:10	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This one-piece suit of clothing reduces one's drag in the water, making swimming easier. It provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Swim checks. The suit only grants this bonus if it is the outermost garment, and has no effect if worn over bulky clothes or armor or with cumbersome gear (such as a backpack, large weapons, and so on). Damage to the suit (such as from several rounds of combat against slashing and piercing attacks) negates the suit's bonus until it is repaired.	BONUS:SKILL|Swim|1|TYPE=Circumstance						
Fire Resistant Boots	TYPE:Goods.Boot	COST:20	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These heavy leather boots contain a layer of brick dust that protects your feet from heat. You gain fire resistance 2 against fire attacks directed at or under your feet, such as walking across hot coals. Repeat or prolonged exposure to fire damage eventually burns the outer leather of the boots, ruining them (typically after about 1d10+20 rounds of exposure).	ABILITY:Special Ability|VIRTUAL|Resistance To Fire	BONUS:VAR|FireResistanceBonus|2|TYPE=Resistance	SLOTS:2
Fur	TYPE:Goods.Shirt	COST:12	WT:5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:The most basic of cold-weather gear, animal furs serve to keep their wearers warm. Wearing enough fur to cover the body provides a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist cold weather. This does not stack with any bonuses gained from the Survival skill. Furs may supplement another outfit. 							
Outfit (Hot Weather)	TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable	COST:8	WT:4	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Covering your body from head to foot in light, airy cloth keeps you cooler than baring your skin to the sun. This outfit typically consists of a loose linen robe and either a turban or loose head covering and veil. The outfit provides a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist warm or hot weather. This does not stack with any bonuses gained from the Survival skill. 							
Ice Skates	TYPE:Goods.Boot	COST:1	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Each of these calf-high boots bears a vertical blade on the bottom, allowing you to travel swiftly on ice. Wearing ice skates allows you to move on ice at normal speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check (including running and charging), but your movement is reduced to half speed on all other terrain. Donning or removing an ice skate is a full-round action. Skating with only one is possible, but the DC of the Acrobatics check rises to 15.	SLOTS:2
Kilt	TYPE:Goods.Bodywear	COST:0.2	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This heavy pleated skirt is usually worn by men. Most have a specific design or pattern that represents allegiance to a particular clan or other social group.							
Cloak (Patchwork)	TYPE:Goods.Cape	COST:5	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These cloaks are popular among traveling bards, and each patchwork cloak is unique. The patches represent where the traveler has been, and often the performer uses them to recall specific stories from his repertoire. When a bard retires or dies, he often bequeaths his cloak to a young entertainer he mentored or admired.							
Outfit (Pickpocket's)	TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable	COST:5	WT:3	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Outfitted with concealed pockets, this clothing gives you a +2 bonus when hiding small objects on your person.							
Scarf (Pocketed)	TYPE:Goods.Cape	COST:8	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:An elaborate design disguises several small pockets on one side of this scarf. This scarf grants you a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to hide objects on your body. This bonus does not stack with the bonus wearing heavy clothing provides but does stack with bonuses for attempting to hide small objects.							
Poncho	TYPE:Goods.Cape	COST:0.5	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This circle of water-resistant fabric (typically wool or leather) has a hooded opening in the center, making it easy to slip it on or off and protecting your entire body from rain or snow.							
Scarf (Reinforced)	TYPE:Goods.Amulet	COST:10	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP: One side of this 8-foot-long scarf is reinforced with chain links and metal plates. While not enough to provide a benefit to Armor Class, these versatile scarves can be used like a length of chain to climb short distances or bind an enemy. A reinforced scarf has hardness 10 and 4 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 24 Strength check.
Cloak (Cotton/Reversible)	TYPE:Goods.Cape	COST:0.3	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This cloak has an outer layer of fabric and an inner layer of a different color. They are worn for the sake of fashion, in theater performances, or to aid a quick appearance change as part of a disguise. The price varies depending on the cloak's quality, with the low end being a simple linen cloak and the high end being made of silk or decorated with fur trim.
Cloak (Wool/Reversible)	TYPE:Goods.Cape	COST:0.5	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This cloak has an outer layer of fabric and an inner layer of a different color.

Outfit (Royal)	TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable	COST:200	WT:15	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance. A royal outfit is rarely designed for regular wear or inclement weather—or even for donning unaided—as it's presumed that anyone who might be wearing it has plenty of servants to take care of his or her every need. This outfit includes only the clothing, not a royal scepter, crown, ring, or other regal accoutrements.
Skis	TYPE:Goods.Boot	COST:5	WT:20	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Each ski is a flat piece of wood about 5–6 feet long for a Medium wearer, curled up slightly at the front end, with lengthwise grooves along the underside and a wooden or metal bracket with laces on top for holding the wearer's boot in place. Wearing skis allows you to move on snow and ice at normal speed, but your movement is reduced to 5 feet on all other terrain. You normally use a pair of spiked poles to help you move and maintain balance while skiing, but javelins, shortspears, or even trimmed-down saplings will do if nothing else more suitable is available. Donning or removing a ski is a full-round action, though the laces can be cut as a move action (which requires repairing or replacing the laces if you want to use the skis again).	SLOTS:2
Snowshoes	TYPE:Goods.Boot	COST:5	WT:4	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These high-tension nets of rope or sinew in wooden frames are lashed to the feet to spread your weight across the snow, making you much less likely to break through the crust and rendering walking much easier. Snowshoes reduce the penalty for walking through heavy snow by 50%; for example, if moving through snow normally costs you 2 squares of movement (1 square plus a 1 square penalty) per square traveled, snowshoes reduce this cost to 1.5 squares per square traveled. Snowshoes may supplement another outfit.	SLOTS:2
Soldier's Uniform	TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable	COST:1	WT:5	SPROP:The exact details of this item varies from country to country, but typically includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a kilt, a belt, a shirt, gloves, a cloak or jacket, and a hat. The belt includes several loops or rings for tying pouches, a waterskin, a scabbard, and similar things a traveling soldier requires.
Tabard	TYPE:Goods.Shirt	COST:5	WT:1	SPROP:Often worn over armor, this outer garment is usually sleeveless and open at the sides. The broad front provides a canvas for insignias and coats of arms, making a wearer's membership in an order readily apparent.

Bellows	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:1	WT:3	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Bellows are useful for starting fires, providing a +1 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to start or maintain fires.	BONUS:SITUATION|Survival=Start or maintain fires|1|TYPE=Circumstance						
Fortune Teller's Deck (Common)	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:1	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This deck of illustrated cards is used by those in tune with the spirit world to predict the future-and by charlatans to take money from the gullible. A common deck only has simple drawings on simple wooden plaques. A quality fortune-teller's deck usually consists of wooden plaques with painted color images; it is suitable as a focus for the augury spell, and provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Profession (fortune-teller), Profession (medium), and similar Profession checks. A masterwork fortune-teller's deck may be wood, ivory, or even metal, with painted or carved images, and is often highlighted with gold inlays or tiny gems; it has all the benefits of a quality deck, except it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the listed skill checks.

Parasol	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:1	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This folding umbrella is translucent and not waterproof. It cuts down on the heat from direct sunlight. In very hot conditions where the sun is a factor (such as a desert), it gives you a +1 circumstance bonus on your hourly Fortitude saves against heat, and reduces the damage from a failed save by 1 hit point (minimum 1). It provides insufficient protection in conditions of severe or extreme heat. You must hold a parasol in one hand and use it to shade yourself from the sun. Alternatively, you can hold the parasol and use it to shade another creature of your size or smaller.							
Umbrella	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:2	WT:3	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Umbrella: An umbrella is a heavier, waterproof parasol made of oiled or waxed cloth. It is intended to keep you dry in the rain or snow, but can still protect against sunlight just like a standard parasol.							
Stretcher	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:1	WT:10	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:A stretcher allows two people to share the burden of carrying one heavy object. You can also use it to drag a load you couldn't carry on your own. A stretcher holds up to 300 pounds.							
Air Bladder	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:0.1	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Used by swimmers for longer dives, this bladder is similar to a waterskin, but is relatively airtight. If inflated, it holds enough air to sustain a Medium creature for 1 round or a Small creature for 2 rounds.							
Animal Glue	TYPE:Goods.General.Consumable	COST:0.5	WT:0.2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This simple glue is created by extensively boiling animal skin, bones, hooves, horn, and tendons until they turn into a ochre syrup that cools when it hardens. Before you use animal glue, you must heat it until it liquefies. You normally apply it with a brush and hold the pieces together for a minute, at which point it is cooled and hardened. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check. Animal glue slowly dissolves in water, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per 10 minutes. It softens if heated, even with steam, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per minute.							
Astrolabe	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:1000	WT:6	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are mounted. The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to spin and move as days pass. The bottom disc represents the latitude of the user; an astrolabe is useless if the user is outside the preset latitude. The upper disc represents the sky, and is filled with astronomical features. Anyone can be shown how to use an astrolabe at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1 minute). When using an astrolabe, you can make a Survival check using your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to avoid becoming lost.							
Backpack (Masterwork)	TYPE:Goods.Container.General.Resizable.Masterwork	COST:50	WT:4	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This backpack has numerous pockets for storing items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Any	EQMOD:MWORKT					
Bandolier	TYPE:Goods.Container.General.Resizable	COST:0.5	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This leather belt is worn over one shoulder and runs diagonally across the chest and back. It has small loops or pouches for holding eight objects the size of a flask or small dagger. You can use the 'retrieve a stored item' action to take an item from a bandolier.

Bell Net	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:2	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:Copper bells hang at each the corners of this 5-foot-by-5-foot wire net. A bell net is designed to blanket gear while you sleep, hunt, cook, or otherwise can't give it your full attention, rasing an alarm if your possessions are disturbed. Creatures attempting to access gear protected by a bell net must succeed at a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check to avoid chiming the bells. Hearing the chiming bells of a bell net requires a DC 0 Perception check. Because the many bells chime when you move, traveling with a bell net gives you a -2 penalty on Stealth checks.	BONUS:SKILL|Hide,Move Silently|-2						
Breakaway Chains (Masterwork)	TYPE:Goods.General.Masterwork	COST:65	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:These masterwork chains are easy to break, even though they look like normal chains (Perception DC 25 to notice the difference). A DC 10 Strength check breaks them instantly.							
Buoy (Common)	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:5	WT:16	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a later date. A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent creatures determined to sabotage them.							
Buoy (Superior)	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:10	WT:30	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a later date. A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent creatures determined to sabotage them. A superior buoy has a spherical or ovoid hollow metal float (typically copper), a length of chain rather than twine, and a metal anchor rather than a weight.							
Butterfly Net	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:5	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:One end of this 6-foot-long pole supports a wide metal hoop covered by a thin mesh net. You can use this to sift objects from material capable of passing through the net, such as sand or water. You can also use a butterfly net to capture Fine or Diminutive creatures as if it were a net (weapon), though you don't need to re-fold the butterfly net if you miss, and you use the handle of the butterfly net like you would the rope of a net weapon. 							
Camouflage Net	TYPE:Goods.General	COST:20	WT:5	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:This loose mesh of twine and varicolored cloth is used to disguise the presence of creatures or large objects. Camouflage netting must be manufactured to provide camouflage in a single type of terrain, such as snow, sand, forest, grass, swamp, urban, or water. When you hide under the netting in the appropriate terrain, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering up with camouflage netting is a full-round action requiring a DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the netting and do not gain its bonus on Stealth checks). You have the entangled condition when using the netting, except your Dexterity penalty does not affect your initiative or Stealth checks. Taking off camouflage netting is a move action, or a swift action if combined with a move action to stand up from a prone position.&nl;You may spend 1 minute covering an object with camouflage netting. Make a Survival check with a -10 penalty and use the total as the Stealth check result for the object. Creatures who fail a Perception check against this Stealth DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the Survival check penalty is -20 instead of -10. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 camouflage nets and takes 1 hour of work, and the Survival check penalty is -30 instead of -10.&nl;A creature with the scent ability ignores the effect of camouflage netting and makes checks against your actual Stealth roll when in scent range. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by camouflage netting automatically recognizes it as an object covered in camouflage.							
Candle Lamp	TYPE:Goods.General.LightSource.Container	COST:5	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:PRD	SPROP:A candle lamp is a small lanternlike device with glass panels and a slot to hold a candle.

The listed price includes the cost of a simple brand or non-fading black tattoo; add appropriate tattoo costs if you want something more elaborate.

When using a periscope, the end of the tube counts as a Diminutive object, making it much less likely that an observed creature notices you; if you have total concealment from the creature except for the end of the periscope, use the tube's Diminutive size modifier on your Stealth check instead of your own size modifier. Distortion from the mirrors gives you a -4 penalty on Perception checks while looking through the periscope. Though the tube is fairly sturdy (hardness 5, 2 hit points), the mirrors inside are fragile (hardness 1, 1 hit point), and any damage that gets through the tube's hardness applies to the tube and the mirrors.
